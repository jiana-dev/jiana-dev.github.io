...if you know where to look.

<p>Last night, I sat down to edit a Youtube video, and I got pulled into the rabbit hole, except this time, it wasn't a Youtube rabbit hole as usual, it was a different rabbit hole. A personal website rabbit hole? A general internet rabbit hole? I don't know, who cares, the point is that for the next 4.5 hours, I was discovering a part of the internet I didn't even know existed.
</p>

<p>
I literally created this post by going through my Chrome History and trying to replay what happened. Upon reading this, perhaps you'll also go down the rabbit hole and find something cool too. And if you did, let me know, let's share! I encourage you to create your own little rabbit hole post like I'm doing now. It's kinda fun.
</p>



## Where it all began

It started with me getting distracted (*what's new?*) looking up how people added comments to their static blogs. I didn't even plan to do this in that very moment, I just knew this was one of the next things I wanted to incorporate onto my website, and I like creating that bridge when I finish things for the day, because it creates like... a self-inflicted cliffhanger for me to get excited about and latch onto the next day. I think Twyla Tharp calls it "building a creative bridge" in **The Creative Habit**.

A few too many clicks later, I found [this girl's blog](https://www.taniarascia.com/), and I thought, *Oh pretty cool, pretty cool, a software developer female with a blog containing things that are potentially useful and interesting to me*. It wasn't my exact same aesthetic, but I could really appreciate where she was coming from with it. I wanted to learn more so I just kept command + clicking, and just like that, we had entered the rabbit holes.



## Rabbit Hole 0: [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/)

Like I said before, the aesthetic wasn't personally my own, but I liked that it cut the fluff, felt fast, effective, and to the point. The layout was so clean and simple.  I found her writing succinct and confident, yet still humble.

I think it was when I started reading about why her blog has no ads, no sponsorships, and no distractions that I got intrigued. What an interesting and noble concept. I definitely want to consider that for my space. Especially after reading [Digital Minimalism](https://jianajavier.com/blog_posts/digital_minimalism), I feel this obligation to make the internet a cool place again. I liked that Tania was going for that.

 I started reading a bunch of her articles sprinkled in between the other rabbit holes I fell into. Maybe you'll find one or two interesting too.

[2020 Website Redesign](https://www.taniarascia.com/another-website-redesign/) - The post that sparked my interest in her other posts, and also what I've been doing so I was into it.

[2020 into 2021](https://www.taniarascia.com/2020-into-2021/) - I just love reading people's year in reviews.

[Private Content Git Submodules](https://www.taniarascia.com/git-submodules-private-content/) - Her tutorial on allowing her blog to be open source code, but also keeping her content a little more private. Something I bookmarked for me to do in the future.

[Adding Github comments to static blog](https://www.taniarascia.com/add-comments-to-static-site/) via [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) - Super cool. I will definitely be trying this out for my site.



## Rabbit Hole 0.5: [Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com/archives-list/)

Although not quite my style, I can appreciate the content found here. And at this point, I trusted my good friend Tania Rascia, so why not right?

[Own The Tools](https://www.raptitude.com/2020/12/own-the-tools/) - Why he looks things up in a physical dictionary



## Rabbit Hole 2: https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden

Now this— this was my favourite rabbit hole. Was so glad I fell into this one. Please, give it a read if you've got the time.

This eye opening idea of a digital garden. Wow! This felt like the idea that has been baking in my head for so long about wanting to create a space on the internet where people teach people by sharing their interests. Phrasing it as a "**Digital Garden**" I felt was brilliant. It really was like a garden! And people can come by and stop by your patch, marvel at your stuff, and if they like your plants, you can give them all the tips and tricks you've gathered. Wow.

And even more importantly the idea that you can let some plants die! I abandon things all the time and beat myself up over it. But not everything needs to be in a finished state. * *mic drop* *

It was like he was preaching to the choir.

>  The entries on this page aren't all complete thoughts. It's a space for me to post what I like and I try not to hoard drafts like some sort of digital Smog. Instead I choose to just let things fly and circle back to them later if I feel like it.

*PREACH JOEL! THIS IS HOW I DO EVERYTHING IN LIFE AND THIS HELPED ME REALIZE IT WAS A-OKAY.*

I added [Badass: Making Users Awesome](https://joelhooks.com/badass-making-users-awesome-by-kathy-sierra) to my reading list, and after going down a few more rabbit holes, went back to explore more on his website and even signed up for the newsletter! I wasn't kidding when I said I was inspired. It helped that he was also a dev.

At first, the layout of [Joel's site](https://joelhooks.com/) mystified me. No chronological ordering? Just a search? What is this? My MacBook? (*that's a reference to using Spotlight/Alfred for everything lol*) His [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) post explained the unusual layout.

>Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren't how people actually use the internet.

> For the most part we use search via Google to find stuff, which is free form and task oriented. You want something, you know what you want, you can string a few words together and hope to get lucky.

So true! This really made me feel like I needed a better search feature. I'm working on it! I'll be looking into [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch), thank you, Tania Rascia.



## Rabbit Hole 3: https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/

This was a smaller rabbit hole. I loved the idea of the "[/now]([/now](http://nownownow.com/about))" project, where you add a page that hosts what you're currently learning, doing, up to. And if you keep adding to it, it would be so cool to see the archives in the future (*as is the case with all journalling really*).

Even the spinoffs (ex. "[/canon](https://github.com/bschlagel/canonize)") were cool— it's a place where you can essentially house everything that makes up the essence of you! I was really inspired to create one of my own.



## Rabbit Hole 4: https://nownownow.com/ & [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/)

I am definitely going to try to incorporate [this](https://nownownow.com/ ) on my blog, and I think it's a really cool place to find other people's blogs too. Anyone who is the type of person to even do these kind of "now" updates is a person I want to be following, so win for everyone.

I read a little bit on [Derek Sivers'](https://sive.rs/) site too. He sounds like the cool kind of person I want to be friends with (based on what I could gather from his Me in 10 seconds and [this one blog post I read/listened to about the benefits of a daily journal and topic journals](https://sive.rs/dj)).

I already write in a journal every morning since January, and have been loving the glimpses into my life. Already I see the benefits, but adding on top of it this idea of "**Thoughts On**" journals, is super cool. I'm definitely going to be incorporating this into my slice of the internet.



## Tangent

At this point, I was so inspired that I finally bought a domain. I decided the $17/year was worth it. 'Cause who's going to believe in me if I'm not believing in me!?

I am proud to announce we are now living at [jianajavier.com](https://jianajavier.com). Pretty cool, huh?

When I was buying my new domain, I remembered my other failed project, hah. I don't think I've revealed this on the internet before, but **basically**, I wanted to test out an idea after being inspired by **The 4-Hour Workweek** by Tim Ferriss. I created a landing page to test interest and put up a one week Google Ad campaign [here](http://www.lifeswapapp.com/).

My idea was that with all this Work-From-Home new remote world shenanigans, we may as well be living it up and sharing our cool home experiences with one another!

The long story short is that I don't think people understood my form for what it was trying to do. I got a lot of garbage responses that rendered a lot of the data meaningless. Maybe it was the wording of the ads, maybe it was the locations I was advertising to, but nonetheless, I didn't think it was an actual profitable enough idea for me to implement. Facebook groups to achieve the same thing would have to do. And that's okay, it was a fun time.

I learned how to make a Google Ad campaign, create a cool mockup, integrate Google forms so I didn't have to have a back-end, and put up my first little page on the internet.

Alright, let's end this walk down memory lane and return to our rabbit holes.



## Rabbit Hole 5: [Tom Critchlow on Digital Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)

This was another rabbit hole I **loved** being down. The idea of a [wiki](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) had me thinking,*This is exactly what I wanted to portray with my blog!! Hooray!!* I love that someones notes, drafts, ideas can be out there with no pressure, and for others to learn and grow from. *If they want.*

It's like... open source, but... *for life*!? For *guidelines*? For *learning*? I don't know, but did I mention I'm loving it?

[Tom's content on digital gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) (which I found via Joel Hooks) touched upon this idea of [**Stock over flow**](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/#stock-over-flow) inspired by [Robin Sloan's piece](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890).

**Flow** is like the feed, the Instagram, the social media, the date based posts. My interpretation is that these are the things that become less and less relevant as time goes by. Then there's the **stock**.

> *Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.*

Cool way of putting it right?! Anyone? Okay, well I thought so!

That post also has a bunch of resources at the bottom that led to my other rabbit holes.



## Rabbit Hole 5.5: http://worrydream.com/#!/quotes

Who doesn't love a list full of curated wise quotes that doesn't involve me logging into a social media platform susceptible to all the dangers and distractions. +1 for Tom Critchlow's site bringing me here.

Here's the one I took down 'cause it really inspired me:

>Somewhere around every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field. Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to hardware, to software, and so on, periodically, because you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new field, you have to start over as a baby. You are no longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there and you can start planting those acorns which will become the giant oaks. ...

> You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and before you use up all the old ones. You can do something about this, but it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say, "Yes, I will give up my great reputation." For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said, "Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are going to try and do something else other than coast on that."



## Rabbit Hole 6: https://notes.busterbenson.com/

I started reading one of the [year in reviews](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/44-Year-of-the-Amateur--A1I6fGSn30hLhQMF5kpFCXC7AQ-xzFR0pPTrr36OFxt7h86h) and I just loved the positive spin he puts on the term **amateur**. It kinda makes you say, "Yeah, I'm an amateur—and proud! I don't know how to do all the things, and that's precisely what gives me the strong potential to be better and look at things from a unique angle."

Beautiful!

I also really liked his [Values in Living](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/vFCWwO4LpAjZow0Rum8T9) so much that I'd like to define this in my own life. I think I've made an attempt after reading **7 Habits**, but nothing I've looked back on and revised.

This value he had hit me real hard.

> I value facing things that make me uncomfortable, to find out which value it is threatening.

Yes, let's facilitate growth!

I've been reading a book called **Start With Why** by Simon Sinek and it's really making me look at life through this lens of **WHY**. What is the **WHY** that is the driving force of all my **HOW**'s and **WHAT**'s? The **WHY** is something I'm currently working on. I think I'm getting closer— I think my purpose has something to do with **WHAT** I'm doing right now, like sharing my experiences, but when it comes to **WHY**, I admit I'm a little fuzzy. I want to enable others to maximize learning and growth by crowdsourcing experiences so everyone can reach a higher frequency together. But I don't think I've fully nailed that purpose yet. I think defining my Values in Living will give me a good cornerstone to make decisions from (something that's already very hard for me) and also help in defining my why.

Through Buster's website, I also found out about [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/). An app that turns any Google sheet into an app. How cool is that? Like *whaaaaat*? I'm definitely trying this out.



## Rabbit Hole 7: https://zander.wtf/

I believe I found this through Tania Rascia's site. The aesthetic didn't appeal to me at first, but then I started reading. [You know I love me a year in review](https://zander.wtf/blog/2020-review). I just love content that is a reflection with lessons learned and the whole bit. Gimme those lessons learned people! I want to learn from you!

Zander spoke about his [blog move from Next.js to Gatsby](https://zander.wtf/blog/site-redesign-2020). As I kept reading, I was getting more and more concerned with each word because I had just chosen to use Next.js over Gatsby for my blog. Did I make a mistake!? Anyways, I read that and re-evaluated my decision, and am still debating it an entire 24 hours later and probably will until I read enough things to convince myself it's all good.



## The Final Rabbit Hole: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/

The most beautiful, animated *(sidenote: it reminded me of magical realism from one of my favourite shows, Jane the Virgin)* blog I've ever seen. Now there's this side of me that loves the aesthetic of neutral tones, simplistic design and is satisfied by that. And then there's this side of me that wants to make things a little off, a little quirky, but while still keeping it cute. Can anyone relate?!

Anyways, I absolutely loved experiencing this blog and it inspired me to [dedicate time to learning CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/the-importance-of-learning-css/). He was absolutely right when he said this is a weak spot for a lot of developers, and I'm no exception. Honestly, I shy away from front-end stuff sometimes 'cause... just *ugh*. It just makes no sense at times. But it's because I didn't care to take the time to understand what lies at the core of my tools. It's been like 4 years since I started dabbling in web development, I think it's about time lol.



## Climbing out of the rabbit holes

After swirling around some more on all of the websites and following all the hyperlinks, making sure I had explored every path of interest, my head was buzzing with ideas and my Drafts inbox full to the brim.

<ImageWithCaption small src="/images/rabbit-holes/drafts.jpg" alt="My Drafts Inbox"/>


It was getting close to my bedtime, so I looked up more on Next.js vs Gatsby and decided it was time to call it a night.



## Here are my takeaways from this adventure

* I should set aside rabbit hole time. This was really fun for me. I was introduced to a bunch of cool resources that I wouldn't have found on any social media platforms. I used to think this was time-wasting, but the amount it has inspired me makes it worthwhile, I think.
* There's still an entire world of internet outside of social media where people are hosting ***really high quality content.*** I've limited myself to what Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, what-have-you serves me, and this is how I get all my advice and recommendations. But the people that have blogs that lurk outside these realms are so super cool! It sucks that unless they have a Youtube channel, or have some other form of effective advertisement, they may go by unnoticed. Like does the Youtube community know about all of this cool stuff? Well if they don't, I'm going to shout it from the rooftops cause dayum!
* This touches upon the last point but imagine the internet world at your fingertips when you just take that bit of time to seek the content you crave, rather than having it served and curated towards you via social media!
* This whole adventure really got me thinking about what I want to contribute. I really wanted to create a space where people can join to just vibe on certain topics of interest productively, but I'm starting to realize that the people who are likely to do that, are already doing it. On their own blogs! There may still be space for what I want to create, but I really want to leverage the fact that this information kind of already exists on the internet— it might not need to be facilitated by "another social media platform". That's the last thing I want. So, I've shifted a little bit. How can I facilitate a way to bring these corners of the internet together in a manageable, maintainable way? If you have any ideas about how, ***please***, reach out to me! I'm a big **WHY** and **WHAT** thinker, but when it comes to **HOW**, I feel I have a hard time. I would love to meet you all who if you can share this vision with me.
  * I'll give some examples that applied to my life for better context.
  * If I look up Next.js vs Gatsby on Youtube, I'm probably going to get curated content that someone has prepared with comparisons of the two. But this is far from holistic. Even if I look it up on Google, I'm gonna get a select few articles from places like Medium and other coding social media platforms. But I wanna hear from the people who have done it. I want to read a blog like Zander's or Tania Rascia's and understand why they *really* chose what they chose. I want to find someone who chose Next.js, see the product of their efforts, and have a discussion about that.
  * If I want to add comments to my blog without having a database, I'll either do tons and tons of research trying to come up with a way on my own, or it's the same thing as above. I'm going to find a select few blog posts regarding the topic, and pick the one that seems the most manageable. Doesn't that feel somewhat limited? But it's not that no one has done it any other way, I just don't know where to find the real dedicated ones who have! Had I not encountered Tania Rascia's blog, I would have never known to try using [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/). I want to gather these corners of the internet into a conglomerated space for maximum growth!! To spend less time researching something and more time **doing**. *Did I just find my **WHY?** * Lol. And maybe the **HOW** is by getting trusted recommendations from the "experts", the "hobbyists", the people who would have done the homework anyways. Almost like shortcircuiting the research process? But not in a lazy way?
* I can't wait to try out [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/) to make an app out of a spreadsheet. Even though I've relentlessly worked on my Finances app, I wonder if I could do this there instead.
* I can't wait to make a now page, a canon page, an I value page, a thoughts on page, and just learn and grow in public.



## Other nuggets from my fall

* [An interactive blog](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/). So cool.
* [How to be an adult Medium Post](https://medium.com/@NataliMorad/how-to-be-an-adult-kegans-theory-of-adult-development-d63f4311b553)
* Idea of [surfing incoherence](https://thesideview.co/journal/surfing-incoherence/)
* Joel Hook's product - https://egghead.io/ - This is kinda like what I wanted to create for all different topics, not just coding
* [Highlighting and annotating PDFs from an iPad](https://joelhooks.com/pdf-expert) by Joel Hooks
* [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) mentioned by Tania Rascia. A fuzzy search for my blog, yes please!
* I need to improve [my site performance](https://web.dev/measure/). I mean I don't *need* to but it's a personal challenge I want to take on.
* [Zander's post](https://zander.wtf/blog/site-redesign-2020) made me realize I should probably put all my posts in MDX
* [I LOVE THIS GUY'S ANIMATIONS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/)
* The [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). From Buster Benson's blog, *Our tendency for those with low ability at a task to overestimate their ability more than people who have higher ability.*



Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my actual random dive into rabbit holes. I enjoyed making this post as it felt like it put a little bit of organization to the chaos that occurs in my brain. I also feel like it's somewhere I can come back to instead of maybe throwing everything in Notion.

That's what I love about having my own personal space like this, I'm not bound by the structure of Notion, or the confines of any blogging site, or social media, or by any other app. This is my space, where I can freely write, and you can freely explore (*with the exception of the login I made for my journal, cause those thoughts are a little personal, so I wanna make sure that we're friends first, heh*).

Let me know if you liked this. I'd love to keep doing it anyways because I think it has tremendous value, but maybe I'll get a little better at organizing it the way I want.

We're all works in progresses and that's okay!

See ya when I see ya,
