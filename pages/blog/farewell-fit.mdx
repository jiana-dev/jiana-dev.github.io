This morning, I woke up to sign into the last day at my first company out of university. This is it, it's actually over. I gave my notice two weeks ago, but the actual day hits different.

Every memory I've ever had here came flooding back.

I remember bugging Etienne endlessly in my first few weeks, taking notes, and trying to absorb all of his knowledge. That knowledge resurfaced when I combined my love for documentation, wanting to do well at being a buddy, and not wanting to have to talk so much. Cue Developer Onboarding Tips.

I remember Ruby's first day, and having lunch with her and Kal at Khao San Road and talking about games. That turned into her coming to my newly-moved-into, developer-job enabled condo before the first Christmas party. And being the best of friends from there, constantly having our Slack side chats on every thing happening in the office.

I remember meeting Stephen for the first time when we were both running late to Paul's tech orientation in the elevator. How he invited me to the group lunches around the round tables where we would fit one too many people just so we could all sit together. And how I wouldn't make a peep in the beginning because it took me a while to feel comfortable around groups.

I remember being so nervous but proud of myself when I finally mustered up the courage to introduce myself to MG. It helped that the kindness in his eyes was instantly comforting.

I remember the inspiration, intimidation, and reverence of being a new developer around Adnan. Our awkward (on my part) head nod + smiles as we passed each other in the office. Right from the start, he set up a chat with the younger developers at the time to facilitate our learning. That was when I learned that learning was deeply embedded within the dev culture here.

I remember how cool it felt for everyone to gather around the library at the end of the day on Thursdays and dedicate time to sharing. I remember how Adnan coolly deflected questions back making me thankful for those who did ask them but never dared to ask myself. We were all becoming better devs just being there.

I always felt so intimidated by RLITs, and I never thought I would have the courage to do one myself. I only sheepishly did my first one when we were all already remote. (:

I remember lazily rolling my chair all the way over to the other side of the office because I was on the U.S. side now. Where we had huge stand meetings and everyone was super motivated. I remember being intimidated by the team at first, but settled in quickly.

I remember all the times I got to experience the wonderful people at work in a new context, and getting to see everyone let loose. At Paul's party, I thought  it was so cool to see everyone have fun together by choice. And going on the Blue Mountain ski trip and connecting with people I never had before, going *way* out of my comfort zone.

I remember Mike and Patrick singing in a karaoke bar the first time I went out with coworkers. And the night where my Anfa, Patrick, my best friend Melissa, and I snuck into the office late at night to eat McDonald's.

And the bar in the junction, smoking weed with a group I had never hung out with before, and then getting a ride home with Paul. I remember in that same bar, Adnan and Karen asked me what I would want to be if I could do anything in the world, and I unexpectedly honestly answered "Youtuber". I remember Karen saying she could see me doing that and that meaning the world to me.

I remember obligatory Monday morning stands where if you were lucky, your work would get a feature (not really a feature, I'm exaggerating) from the PM/TPO. And none of us really got too much value out of the meeting but really it just became a time for us to see the whole tech team in one room so it was kinda nice.

I remember breaking into the U.S. Servicing team with Elan, Destin, Marina, and Paul and feeling like a power team, and then realizing that any team with Elan was a power team. I would brace myself for code reviews trying not to take it personally (since I'm a sensitive butt), while simultaneously knowing that every comment was a growing pain that made me a better developer. Retrospectively looking back, I grew by pure osmosis of sitting next to Elan.

I remember spending weeks of planning and figuring out how to implement U.S. Payments with requirements changing daily but having so much fun.

I remember graduating from being on Elan's team to a new servicing team with full autonomy because Saraubh didn't do anything.

I remember shuffling teams tons of times and slowly creeping unknowingly into a role of leadership where I was honoured to collaborate with Elan over high-level concepts rather than needing full guidance. And then being able to pass on what I learned to Jake.

I remember asking Paul for more time at home because Stephen and I adopted a little kitty and him being so understanding. I remember saying I'd send pics but I don't think I ever did.

I remember the builds never destined to be green, and leaky tests, and the absolute **joy** of prod replicas.

I remember sitting next to Santhosh, and in front of Jake feeling super chill to be on a team with two quiet people like me. I remember getting together on the giant USA team, and learning from Elan's presentation on podcasting, and Manas' presentation on personality types.

I remember having Elan as my manager and him asking me if I would be interested in being one but thinking it was a ways away in the future, only to be pleasantly surprised, yet sad to be losing him as a manager. And then getting excited to find out that Brittany would get to be my report especially since our awesome chat in her interview.

I remember having to muster up the courage to do company demos and writing every single thing down so I wouldn't get caught off guard. And always attending when Elan presented because you knew it would be funny and entertaining.

I remember going out of my comfort zone to join board game nights and being scared to spend time with different groups but realizing that no matter the group, it was gonna be good times because it was all good people. Winning Viticulture once helped, too (:

I remember the good vibes of the cottage retreat. Joseph's hilarious spiel, playing codenames downstairs, Ramanaa encouraging me to face my fears, and smoking weed with Ramanaa and Patrick in the car like we were in high school again.

I remember Kal introducing me to Tricky Towers and how cool but unnerving it's resemblance to Tetris was. Tetris with gravity!? It couldn't be.

Every bittersweet goodbye at Roxy's and Watson's. Every Friday morning Little Nicky's run.

Growing tremendously as a dev. From Teresa teaching me that I should probably read the docs, to setting up my full terminal development environment, to geeking out with people on Vim shortcuts. And only doing a Rails tutorial a year into the job, and finally feeling like I had a good handle on things. Kinda late, but a testament to my winging skills, right? It's gotta count for something.

And growing tremendously **as a person**. From getting to grow on a team with Hani, and learn from each other's methods, to having to communicate and speak up about sociological issues within the team. I was pushed to and fro my comfort zone and came out of it a better person.

This has been a long post already, and there are so many more things to remember, I couldn't possibly list them all. The point is, this journey has been nothing short of incredible. No amount of repetitive run-on sentences are going to capture it all.

I have been able to come out of my shell, but only just how much I wanted to, and I was still able to shine. This company and the team have provided me with just the right dash of learning and development, actively and by osmosis, and I couldn't be more grateful.

Although I'm afraid to move on, I am thankful for Fit giving me the courage to make the leap. Even though my time at the company is over, the person and developer it has shaped me into lives on.

Now, on to the next adventure!
