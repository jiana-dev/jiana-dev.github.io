I'm sitting slouched at my desk, in the corner of my office, scrolling through Airbnb  for cottage getaways in Ontario. It's been raining for the past few weeks and it's forecasted to keep going. We've been in lockdown for the past month and another extension is likely on the horizon. I haven't done so much as take a walk in weeks and I'm paying for it with each sluggish day.

The thing is, I have it pretty good. My partner and I are living spaciously in our first home, and I'm enabled to do all of my hobbies with room for more. Life should be good. But I'm still here, mindlessly scrolling, longing for an escape from what feels like an imprisonment of my own mind.

All the cottages have been booked because it's mid-May and it's slim pickings for the picky. I can't afford to choose my top choice because I have no friends to split the cost. I either pay an absurd amount of money for a less than ideal experience or risk not going anywhere. 

Meanwhile, people are *actually* suffering, kids can't go to school, everyone is concerned for their loved ones, and my privileged butt is crying that I can't go on vacation. I slouch deeper into my chair of entitlement.

I click page 13 out of 15 in "Ontario Cottages" for the 3rd time this morning. I don't know what it's going to take to teach myself that the late bird can't expect to get the best worm. Each click fuels what feels like a self-loathing flame in my brain.

In an attempt to soothe my sadness, I dive deeper into the list of *Things I Can't Do* and search *British Columbia, Canada*. I click on the first treehouse. My eyes light up at a photo of a wild blackbear. The flame gets bigger. I scroll through the photos, while completely ignoring my feelings of helplessness.

Before I know it, I'm typing *Costa Rica* and I've now committed arson within my own mind. I hastily put my computer to sleep to think about what I've just done.

The next couple seconds feel like hours as I come to realize a few things.

I am dragging my way through life desperately latching onto the excitement of one fragile plan to the next. I am in constant *waiting* mode. I am waiting for the gyms to open before I work out. I am waiting for the stores to open to start a project. I am waiting for the perfect weather to take a walk. I am waiting for the lockdown to be over for my life to begin. I am waiting for a thread of certainty to grasp onto so I can finally start living my life again.

Only, I **am** living, this **is** my life. And I am making the choice to let it pass by while I mentally live in a more exciting time. Times that may never turn out to be as I picture in my fantasyland.

I type in my password to unlock my computer. "Costa Rican Modern Luxury Treehouse" is staring me in the face. It takes everything in me to press Command + W and extuingish the fire. But I do it, because the only responsibility I have right now is to make the most out of right now.

I turn to my partner, glance at the overcasted skies, and invite him for a walk.
