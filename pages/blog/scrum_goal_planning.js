      <p>Welcome back to my brain, friends. The goal of this post is to give you an idea for a <strong>structured way to organize your goals using concepts borrowed from software development processes.</strong></p>
      <p>First, let&#39;s give you some context.</p>
      <p>In software development, there are a lot of different frameworks for bringing an idea to an end product. The one we&#39;ll be talking about is called <strong>Scrum.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Scrum</strong> (as defined by <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary">the scrum glossary</a>) is a framework to support teams in complex product development. Scrum consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules, as defined in the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>
      <p>You don&#39;t need to know much about this other than it is what this whole planning idea is based on. There is so much more to scrum than what I&#39;ll be showing here but you can use this as a starting point and do additional research on how you can leverage it to help you identify, plan, visualize, and achieve your goals.</p>
      <p>In this blog post, I&#39;ll go through an example, to demonstrate how I use these concepts borrowed from scrum to achieve and plan my goals. There are key definitions in the table below.</p>
      <h3 id="how-to-use-scrum-to-plan-your-goals">How To Use Scrum to Plan Your Goals</h3>
      <p>In this example, I&#39;ll be choosing one goal to run through this process but realistically, you&#39;ll want to do this for each thing you dump into your <strong>Backlog</strong>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Choose how you will measure your time and effort. This will be your <strong>estimation</strong> measurement. In our case, we will use the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> like a <strong>timebox</strong> you give yourself to measure task completion.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/estimation.png" alt="estimation"/></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Identify and dump your goals and ideas into your <strong>Backlog</strong> (this is intended to be an ongoing process everytime you think of something new)</p>
          <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/backlog 1.png" alt="backlog"/></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h6 id="refinement-grooming">Refinement/Grooming</h6>
      <ol start='3'>
        <li>Classify your goals into categories. We&#39;ll use Large, Medium, Small.</li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/backlog 2.png" alt="backlog"/></p>
        <li>Prioritize your goals. Choose the ones that are most important to you, as many as you think are achievable within one year, for instance. Order them by perceived impact and desirability.</li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/backlog 3.png" alt="backlog"/></p>
        <li>Take the goal and break it down into smaller pieces, preferably one conceptual level down (Large to Medium, Medium to Small).<sup><a href="#cliffnote-1">1</a></sup></li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/backlog 4.png" alt="backlog"/></p>
        <li>If needed, break down again until we are at the smallest level. Ensure the goal is measurable by your chosen time in Step 0. <sup><a href="#cliffnote-2">2</a></sup></li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/backlog 5.png" alt="backlog"/></p>
        <li>If your Small goal isn&#39;t clear or granular enough, gather <strong>requirements</strong>. <em>What exactly is expected to mark it as <strong>Done</strong>?</em></li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/requirements.png" alt="requirements"/></p>
        <li><strong>Estimate</strong> your Small goals in the measurement above using the Step 0 measurement.</li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/working backlog.png" alt="working backlog"/></p>
      </ol>
      <h6 id="planning">Planning</h6>
      <ol start='9'>
        <li>Choose your <strong>Sprint</strong> timeline.</li>
        <li>Identify how many of your estimation measurement from Step 0 you will be able to complete in one sprint.</li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/sprint timeline.png" alt="sprint timeline"/></p>
        <li>Plan your sprint. Take your small goals and drag and drop into your sprint to build your <strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>.</li>
        <p><img src="../images/scrum_goal_planning/dragdrop.gif" alt="dragdrop"/></p>
        <li>Rinse and Repeat for all goals.</li>

      <p>That concludes the most basic, highest level description of how to use Scrum to break down your goals into manageable chunks. I highly encourage you to play around and choose measurements, estimations, refinement methods, sprint lengths, and backlog breakdowns that work for you. </p>
      <p>At the end of each sprint, there is usually a <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>, where you can reflect on the previous sprint in order to do better for the next one. You can use this to become aware of your limitations (using your estimates), and extend this to challenge yourself by increasing the number of Pomodoro you are able to complete in one sprint.</p>
      <p>There are tons of tools and resources you can use to supplement this. For example, I have been using <strong>Notion</strong> to manage my weekly sprints, <strong>BeFocused</strong> to keep track of my pomodoros. At work, I use <strong>Jira</strong>.</p>
      <p>But this is all I could fit into today&#39;s blog post.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading,</p>

        <li><p id='cliffnote-1'>Note: It is okay that some of it is unknown and therefore you can&#39;t break it down. Try not to overplan. The first few broken down goals are good enough for us to  fill in the blanks later.</p></li>
        <li><p id='cliffnote-2'><em>Optional</em>: If you have <strong>complete requirements</strong> for the goal, you have the choice to plot your Big, Medium, and Small goals accordingly in a Calendar to give yourself deadlines. Doing this without complete requirements is dangerous because you might not have enough information to make accurate estimates that truly are realistic within the deadlines.</p></li>
