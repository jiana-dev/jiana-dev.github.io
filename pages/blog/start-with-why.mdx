I don't remember how I came across this book as a recommendation but I couldn't help but keep coming back to what my therapist told me in one of our first sessions when I was pondering about discovering my purpose in life.

She had said, quite simply, "People don't buy **what** you do. They buy **why** you do it." Just like that, so simply, she lit this small fire in my brain that I didn't ignite fully until reading this book, and now, just like every book I read, has given me this new lens to look through life through, which I'm so grateful for.

To me, this book was about looking at life through the lens of **why**. Starting with why means understanding the values that drive you, the reason for waking up everyday, what you want to deliver to this world. It's what keeps you going when you're stuck, and what fuels almost all of the decisions you make.

This will be a collection of ideas from the book and the reflection it invoked in me. You can get summaries from the internet (I'll also put my [notes](/resources/library/start-with-why) coming straight from the book on my book page) so I'll keep this as focussed as possible on my take on things. In other words, I think it might be more effective for me to tell you **why** I resonated with this book rather than **what** I learned from it.

#### **Idea**

Leaders inspire action. Great leaders see what most of us can't see and give us things we would never think of asking for. The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen. This means an environment of trust. They need to have a vision of a world that does not yet exist along with the ability to communicate it.

#### **Reflection**

*I have always wanted to consider myself a leader. Sometimes I'm put in a position of leadership and I don't always step up to the plate. I let laziness kick in and fall for the "Well, it's not my responsibility" trap often.*

*I also have never really considered myself innovative or anything special. I tend to copy ideas or even if I do think about something unique or forward, I'm inclined to not take any steps to bring the idea to life after convincing myself it's not actually feasible. It's like my entire being has wanted the role of a leader, but my mind and body never cared to step up to the plate.*

*I also have issues trusting people to do things sometimes. I used to always think, "If you want it done right, do it yourself." I'm that girl in the group project that either a. doesn't actually do anything or b. takes the lead, realizes my teammates are lazy, uninterested and at times, pardon my language but, incompetent (as rude as it sounds, I'm sorry, I know they're likely not, but this was my perception at the time), and proceeds to take on the entire project on my own. Or I guess in the rarest of cases, c. works hard in a perfectly harmonious team where someone else stepped up to the plate as a pseudo-leader and I respected them and shared their values such that we all did a fantastic job.*

*So, leader, I have not exhibited, really. I also am pretty botched when it comes to communication. I feel I can't articulate myself very well with words, with speaking mostly. With writing, I feel a bit more in control, but it takes a while after I've vomitted all of my thoughts and laid them all out to structurally organize them in a way that makes sense. So yeah, it's a work in progress for sure. But gathering this definition and understanding expectations is a great first step.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

When a company does not know why it does what it does, chances are the customers and employees feel the same. They end up needing to rely on manipulations like promotions, and discounts to get business. This works but doesn't last. If a company doesn't communicate it's **why**, all we have to go off of is their **what**, and this makes competition stiff.

#### **Reflection**

*I think this is an interesting point because it shows me why it's so easy for me to pick up the latest Apple product without much research and feel good about my decision vs. taking hours to look up a new food scale or monitor on Amazon and still not feel certain about my decision. All I'm getting from a company that hasn't made its **why** clear is their **what** and it's not strong enough to make me feel confident in my decision, because so many other companies are competing with the same **what.** It also shows me why some things are so replaceable. I'm not going to go to Walmart because its a fantastic customer experience, I'm going because it has strawberries on sale for $2 right now. Am I loyal to Wal-mart? Nah. But am I going to keep coming back if they keep having promotions? You betcha. If another supermarket comes along that has slightly higher prices, but a way more fantastic experience, I'd be open to it.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

> “Real innovation changes the course of industries or even society. The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine, iTunes. These are true innovations that changed how we conduct business, altered how we live our lives...”

#### **Reflection**

*I don't know that I've actually ever really been innovative in my life. I noticed I think about things that improve the way things currently are, but rarely do I think outside the box in a way that truly changes the world. I'd like to be more mindful of exercising that part of my brain.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

**The Golden Circle**: What, How, Why

*What is the product we are delivering?*

*How are we doing it?*

*Why are we doing it?*

In marketing, starting with the why is so much more impactful. In adapting to a changing market, we should be starting with why are we doing what we're doing and how can we use the resources we have to adapt to the market we're currently in? Otherwise we will look too hard into what other's are doing and that will only drive a what.

#### **Reflection**

*I feel like this idea explains why some of my ideas die. I'll think of something I'd want to invent or would be cool to exist, see someone else has done it, and then be discouraged about it. That's evidence that my why wasn't strong enough from the beginning I think. Because if it was, I think I would power through that hardship. I would have still been able to see something beyond the what. All too often, when I'm comparing myself to others, I lose my sense of self. It was only last year that I decided I would stop caring that Youtube didn't need another girl talking about tech inserting herself into the mix. It's not about that. It's about sharing the unique message that Jiana Javier has to offer, regardless of what anyone else is doing. It was only when I stopped looking at "has it been done before" that I realized I was being driven by my why. Anything I've ever worked on since then has mostly been driven by a why, because I did it anyways, not knowing if it has been done, or in which way.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

The part of our brain that is in charge of our feelings is the same that controls our why, and it's not one concerned with language. It's the limbic brain. That's why it would be very difficult to articulate **why** you love someone, something, it's something you just "feel in your gut", it's unexplainable.

Asking someone to make a decision on a rational basis is what would lead to "overthinking". Without the **why**, decisions become harder to make, and that's why we look towards empirical data, science.

#### **Reflection**

*I always knew I had such trouble articulating this part of my brain, but now this gives me some sense of validation. It also explains, in love, why it's so hard to say why you love someone, you kinda just do. And I am such an overthinker, it's not even funny. Especially when it comes to a purchase or where I would spend my money. This makes me realize that it's the companies that I have no attachment to whatsoever that drive this indecision. Option A is not much different than Option B, so the debate is likely useless. Neither has shown me **why**, so unless I find a company that does I might as well short-circuit that decision process because at the end of the day, I'm never going to have full certainty that I made the right decision anyways.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Articulate your values as words.

Integrity => I will always do the right thing.



#### **Reflection**

*This is definitely something I want to incorporate, and display to hold me accountable. I never thought about the power of expressing it as verbs, but this is something I will start doing.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Making a rational-based decision => I think it's right.

Making a gut-based decision => I feel it's right.

Knowing your why => I know it's right.

#### **Reflection**

*I love that it gives you this lens from which to look at life. I feel like it's a tool to give you confidence in any decision you make.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Trust within a company, the customer is **not** always right. We all need each other equally. Skills are teachable, hire for attitude. Don't hire skilled employees and motivate them, hire motivated employees and inspire them. But unless you give motivated people something to believe in greater than themselves, they will find themselves motivated to find a new job.

#### **Reflection**

*This isn't the first time I've heard the customer is not always right thing. I think I read somewhere that it's okay to focus on the 20% of the customers who give you 80% of the business. I think it was the 4-Hour Workweek. What I didn't really take in is how much a culture of trust it fosters when the treatment of the employees comes at the forefront of the business.*

*I think the point about hiring not for skills but for motivation is interesting. I conduct interviews at work, and I've never really thought about it this way. It's cool because I wonder that if we did, what the culture would be like. I think we hire a lot on gut feel too though, so at least there's that. The shared culture helps there. I am very grateful that the company I'm at took a chance on me, because I feel like I didn't have the skills, but I've more or less had the motivation. How can I continue to foster that culture?*

*I think it's also really interesting to note that when you hire for skills, or you do hire motivated people, but don't have your vision aligned with the employee, don't give them something greater to believe in, they are bound to take their talents somewhere else, which I've seen numerous times where I work.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Aim for the left side of the bell curve, because the rest will follow. The left perceive greater value in what you do and will happily pay a premium or be willing to endure an inconvenience to be a part of your cause. You shouldn't need to incentivize, because the people who love you will just talk about you, if they truly believe in what you believe.

#### **Reflection**

*For me, this was really influential. Because I've talked about some content I've found on the internet, and I've also not talked about some. I could never really tell the difference between those I did or did not talk about, but seeing it now, the ones I did talk about were the ones that spoke to my limbic brain. Ros on Youtube for example. I loved her spirit, I talked about her to my brother. It was clear she was going for genuinity, having fun, and sharing her talents, and I loved that about her.*

*I want it to be the same for my content. I want to put things out there that show people WHY I'm here and not just cool things I can do. I want my content to have meaning and not be there to generate views.*

*I was obsessed with how this is going to be my business, and it's growth, but really, success follows passion, it doesn't drive it. So I think I'm done thinking about it as my business, and I'll just start focussing on the value I'm delivering to the world.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

There's a difference between the WHY types and the HOW types. WHY's have the vision, the dream, and the HOW's know how to get there.

#### **Reflection**

*This made me feel like maybe this has been my disconnect. Maybe I'm a WHY trying to fit into a HOW. But I guess at first you kind of have to be it all. Or maybe I am a HOW wanting to be a WHY. I've never really come up with anything that innovative. I'm not sure what I am to be honest.*

*But realizing there's a difference has been really interesting for me. It makes me feel like I need to get to figuring out what I am, so that I can find my complementary piece.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

When we build a business or career, we gain confidence in WHAT we do, and experts in HOW to do it, and each achievement is a tangible measurement of success and feelings of progress increase. But most of us somewhere along the line forget WHY we set out on the journey in the first place. This is called the split.

#### **Reflection**

*Really significant idea for me. I feel like I've gotten better as a dev, but why don't I feel any better? Sure, my skills and knowledge have increased, but what else? Is that all there is to it?*

*I think my pursuit for other things, like content creation, and things outside of being a dev has shown me that there's more to my journey than just that, but I feel good that I can use the tools I do have as a dev to make a different splash.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

> “When people know WHY you do WHAT you do, they are willing to give you credit for everything that could serve as proof of WHY. When they are unclear about your WHY, WHAT you do has no context. Even though the things you do or decisions you make may be good, they won’t make sense to others without a clear understanding of WHY.”

#### **Reflection**

*Like my friend who is in pursuit of the influencer lifestyle just because it's a lifestyle he wants. I learned last year that your purpose in life always comes from what you can do to serve others, and only then can it be perceived as authentic, and creates that frame of WHY for people to absorb your WHAT.*

*I think this echoes that concept. Even though you exhibit talent and skill, if your why isn't clear, then it's hard to get people on board. I think it goes back to authenticity. Maybe that's why relatable people are so easy to follow, and you're drawn to them. The way they see themselves in you automatically makes their why's in line with yours. Even if neither of you has clearly defined it.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

> “The WHY does not come from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of any market research. It does not come from extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a process of discovery, not invention.”

> ...

> “When I looked back to my upbringing, I discovered a remarkable theme. Whether among friends, at school or professionally, I was always the eternal optimist. I was the one who inspired everyone to believe they could do whatever they wanted. This pattern is my WHY. To inspire”

#### **Reflection**

*So crazy to think that the answers are within. That all I have to do is look to the past at where I was and what I gravitated towards before.*

*What is mine? I always gave advice, I wrote notes, but didn't always share them. I loved to document things for the benefit of others all the time, but only really started sharing later, when I realized that the uplifting of another is the uplifting of us all. So maybe I've always known my what, but I never shared because I didn't realize my why? I think this is something I'm going to do deeper reflection on, and thank God I have so much documentation of my life to do it with. I think this is going to be a whole process in itself.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Why should we do business with you?

> “Because the work we’re doing now is better than the work we were doing six months ago. And the work we’ll be doing six months from now will be better than the work we’re doing today. Because we wake up every day with a sense of WHY we come to work. We come to work to inspire people to do the things that inspire them. Are we better than our competition? If you believe what we believe and you believe that the things we do can help you, then we’re better. If you don’t believe what we believe and you don’t believe the things we can do will help you, then we’re not better. Our goal is to find customers who believe what we believe and work together so that we can all succeed. We’re looking for people to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us in pursuit of the same goal. We’re not interested in sitting across a table from each other in pursuit of a sweeter deal. And here are the things we’re doing to advance our cause . . .” And then the details of HOW and WHAT you do follow. But this time, it started with WHY.

*I think this is so powerful. I thought about this in the context of an interview. Why should we hire you?*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Langley and the Wright Brothers and the plane story. Langley wanted the fame and fortune, the Wrights' wanted to change the world. Wrights' got there first, and Langley quit.

> “Companies with a clear sense of WHY tend to ignore their competition, whereas those with a fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing.”

#### **Reflection**

*This example really spoke to me. It reminded me of everything I've wanted to do, and seen that someone else has already done, and gotten discouraged because of it.*







<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Starting with Why in Marketing is more effective.

#### **Reflection**

*This explains why for every book review I read, the ones that are most effective are when people say, this invoked this in me. This made me feel X. Rather than give me a summary of the book, which I can get  from the book, it gave me a reason to read it because they told me their reason to read it.*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

The Cathedral Example

#### **Reflection**

*What's my cathedral?*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

The trapeze artist example

#### **Reflection**

*Do I feel that safety net in my place of work? Do I feel empowered to try new tricks and do new stunts to advance myself and the show?*

*Am I the talented trapeze artist swinging by until a better offer comes along? Or am I the one who is one with the circus act I belong to right now?*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

The Celery Test

#### **Reflection**

*This was really interesting for me because it highlighted so much that I had no idea what I stood for as a teen. I made decisions based  on no grounds, based on the grounds that I wanted to fit in, I wanted to have a sense of belonging. I was completely out of balance. I used to also think I'm just a mess, I don't ever really focus in on one thing, I experiment with so many different things and don't have a values system to fall back on. So not only did no one know what I believed, I didn't know.*

*This gives me answers to questions like, should I make a tutorial video or a reflection video? I want to invoke reflection. Anyone can make a tutorial video, and likely do it better than I. I don't think tutorials and how-to's, instructionals, is where my passion or talent lies. When someone tells me they were able to execute something I helped them with based on a step by step, I feel good, but I don't feel fulfilled. When someone tells or shows me that I prompted a reflection in them that allowed them to get to know themselves better and develop a healthier relationship with themselves, I'm over the moon. So, I'm sorry, but I think it's always going to be a reflection video over a tutorial. I'll still sneak em in where they fit, or the tutorial will be for something I think is cool, in which case I'll be focussing on the what, but at least I know that now, and I know how to identify why I feel out of balance with the content I create if I do feel it. Fantastic!*



<hr/>

#### **Idea**

Ben Comen, the boy who ran the race with cerebral palsy.

#### **Reflection**

*The only competition I should be considering is myself. This is something I want to actively work on. I used to watch videos and think all about how this person is ahead of me here, and making this much money doing this, and I need to follow that same path to get to that same success. Nope. That ain't it girl.*



With all this said, I have a lot of reflection to do. I will discover my why. I will work on growing into a great leader, and that means allowing myself to think bigger, and teaching myself how to communicate better. I want to make sure where I work and what I do everyday aligns with my values. I will make sure the content I create is driven by my why. And I will stop being so concerned with the paths of others and focus on my own. It's time for me to start with why. I'll let ya know how it goes.
