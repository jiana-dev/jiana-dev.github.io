| 05/06/21 | Anxiety needs structure. I ***need*** to have a schedule. I suffer from anxiety without one. <hr/> I need to develop my business plan. <hr/> I need to gain a better relationship with my anxiety. Journal about it, talk to it, acknowledge it, work with it. Embrace it? Love it? Lol, one step at a time, Jiana. <hr/> It only takes one toxic person to ruin an entire workplace. Sometimes you just gotta do what's best for yourself and get out. |
