Yesterday was crazy for me. I had what felt like a mental breakdown. I lost it. The product manager on my team passive aggressively put a task on me at the beginning of the day, and it triggered all the negative emotions I've been holding in for a long time when it comes to work.

I was spiralling into negative thoughts about how the culture has fundamentally changed into one that no dev really cares for anymore. Maybe coding isn't for me. What else should I do, what other things can my skills apply to? Even thoughts about quitting working for a company and just roughin' it on my own (without a business lol) clouded my mind.

Stephen supported me tremendously, and encouraged me to book a therapy session. The earliest availability was the next morning.

This morning's therapy session was so illuminating. I was validated to look for another job, I realized my anxiety would thrive off some structure, and I realized I needed a business plan if I wanted to have a business. I never really realized I wanted to have a business until today either. I just thought that maybe my hobby would turn into one by some chance.

So today, I've been exercising this newfound knowledge I gained. I made a schedule for my day which I've been loosely following, I did some research on how I would come up with a business idea and plan. I read, which was an extremely important part of my day. And now, I'm supposed to be vision hunting and going through my past stuff, but I got caught up looking up jobs as a software developer manager. I was looking into coaching earlier, and what problems I could try to solve in the SD space, but ultimately, landing on management has been really interesting.

Yes, I want to coach people and help improve their quality of lives, like a software developer coach, but I think that might be something I can do in the context of a manager. Honestly, ideally though, I could do something freelance-y where I am like an "agile coach" but instead I'm a developer coach. I help your company reduce high turnover!

I think that would be really cool. But that's another thing.

This manager track really excites me. Sure, I'm already a manager now, and I made the decision that I'm going to look for a new job. But I feel like if I quit now,  I'm missing out on valuable behavioural experience content. I feel like I'm at the brink of being able to make a difference at the company, and jumping ship is kinda like me not actually taking advantage of the unique position I'm placed in right now. Really, the only thing I don't want anymore is to be on a team with my PM. So, maybe I can stick within the work context, with aspirations to perhaps jump ship later to a company I can see the vision for, but for now I could really make a difference.

And I could have that difference to talk about when interviewing for a role somewhere else. I could leave my positive mark and use it to propel me into something that aligns with me better.

I'm kind of having that epiphany now. So now I have all these ideas that I need to organize. All the things I want to accomplish and do.

I want to use my management position at work to become a better manager, act as "team lead", and make a **real** impact so that I can eventually use these skills at a company that excites me more. I want to combine these skills with life coaching and think about how I can directly apply it to the software development world, and problems within that. The coaching could be my business. Or I have a different business plan, who knows? I'm still ruminating on that. All this while figuring out what I'm good at, and creating my "affirmation content". Stuff that makes me feel good, and assures me in my core personal values, so that I can work on being present.

Boom!

Okay, this is just where I'm at now. But I'm hopeful. I'm excited to keep going. I still want to prioritize making videos though, so we'll see how that fits into everything. Cause I feel like this is going to be hard. Balancing all these initiatives. For now though, I need to become more engaged in my work, and I'm going to be able to do that by not being on a team with my current PM. Lol.

I feel like a little lego armed and ready with my weapons of mass destruction. I couldn't find a good picture, unfortunately. I wish I had someone who was like good at cute illustrations who could do it lol.
