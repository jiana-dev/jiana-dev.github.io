| [Meta-Creator Ceiling](https://www.swyx.io/meta-creator-ceiling/) | *"I think the way to approach the question of "what do I do to be successful", may be to flip it on its head: Assume you will be successful at whatever game you play. **Are you playing a game you want to win?**"* |
| [Part-Time Creator Manifesto](https://www.swyx.io/part-time-creator-manifesto/) | A really interesting take on "I don't necessarily want to be a creator to "free myself" of an employer, in fact, part-time may be what's ideal for me." |
| [Mental Model for People Who Want to Make High Quality Content](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/the-1-mental-model-for-writers-who-want-to-write-high-quality-viral-content-43ecf0d4ec05) | This article tells you why you shouldn't accept mediocrity in your online content. <hr/> *Every time you share content online, you’re training your readers to either ignore you or stop what they’re doing and read you. Malcolm Gladwell, one of the most successful nonfiction authors ever, has built his brand through the blockbuster model. Rather than focusing on writing an article a week, he’s focused on writing seminal articles and books, which means he only writes a few articles per year and two books per decade.  As a result, Gladwell releasing an article is a shareable event unto itself.* |
