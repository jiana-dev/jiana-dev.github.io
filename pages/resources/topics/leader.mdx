| [Who I Want to Work For](https://keavy.com/work/who-i-want-to-work-for/) | A blog post I was linked to through [swyx.io](https://swyx.io)'s book on what this senior engineer expects from leadership. This is a good guideline for me as I navigate a leadership role. |
| [An interview with Calm's CTO, Will Larson on How to Build a Technical Leadership Career](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/calms-will-larson-on-how-to-build-a-technical-leadership-career/) | *I think one of the core challenges of leadership roles is that, early in a career, you know the most important thing is getting this migration done or launching this product feature. Someone will tell you that. But as you get more senior, people don’t really tell you what you should be doing. They just grade you based on what you’ve done and whether it’s important. And this is a really confusing transition, where you go from knowing exactly what to do and how you’re graded to getting graded based on the perception of whether the work you’re doing is important or not. And often, that perception takes months or sometimes years to actually flip its way to you. It can be quite a confusing moment, and I think that’s what leadership is, no one’s telling you what to do, but they’re still grading you on what you’ve done. And it’s kind of a frustrating moment to figure out. How is this reasonable? And whether it’s reasonable or not, it’s real.* <hr/> Opposing things makes you feel like you're in a position of leadership but all you've really done is stagnate the thing without providing any real value. <hr/> *Typically, going and being negative is perceived as high status, no matter where you are. I think it’s important, once you get into senior leadership, to be thoughtful about where you are negative because you can go into a product planning meeting and shoot down all those ideas, and they’ll be like, “Oh, this is a real leader, not letting us get away with sloppy product thinking.” But if you just stop them from moving forward, all you’ve done is sabotage. You actually haven’t helped. You’re doing work that makes you feel or look like you’re high status or important, but the actual consequences are that the business gets slower, you can’t shift things, and you’ve demotivated the people you need to be leading.* |
