### On having a coach

| [1-on-1 with an engineering coach](https://codeclimate.com/blog/1-on-1-with-mathias-meyer-engineering-coach/) | *It’s useful to have someone who’s impartial, whose only concern is you and not necessarily the organization as a whole, to provide an outside perspective, to be a sounding board, or to call you out. If you’re procrastinating on something, if you’re avoiding a difficult conversation, if you don’t actually know how to have a difficult conversation, a coach can help. They can give you ideas or pull them out of you so you can actually make it through what I like to call the crucibles of management, like having to fire someone, or having a difficult conversation with your co-founders, or with a peer in the organization.* <hr/> This had me dreaming about one day being a coach for an organization but on the people (most attuned towards dev?) level (not necessarily process level). |
