  <p><span className={styles.lead}>T</span>his is the result of a script I wrote to value stocks in any given portfolio according to Peter Lynch's method for a stock's fair value. This method is as follows:</p>
  <code>value rating = p/e ratio / growth rate + dividend yield</code>
  <p>Let me know via email if you'd like me to run this for any other Yahoo Finance portfolios or any ticker symbols in particular!</p>
  <h6><strong>How to read the results:</strong></h6>
  <table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>{'value rating < 0'}</td>
    <td>No predictions on fair value since company's growth or PE is negative.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{'0 < value rating <= 0.5'}</td>
    <td>Amazing! Stock is selling for less than or equal to half of what it's worth.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{'0.5 < value rating <= 1'}</td>
    <td>Pretty good. The stock is selling for a bit less than what its worth.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{'value rating = 1'}</td>
    <td>Stock is exactly at a fair value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{'1 < value rating < 2'}</td>
    <td>Not great. The stock is selling for more than and up to double it's worth.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>value rating > 2</td>
    <td>Way overpriced.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
