After reading this, I felt like I had a good grasp on what it means to be financially literate. It eliminated the <em>\"You don't know what you don't know\"</em> feeling when it comes to money. I highly recommend this book.",

###### What is it about?

- The Bible of Financial Literacy
- Framework and mindset for how to approach money
- How to think like a winner and be smart (not just in money)
- How the traditional path is rarely the best path for you

###### What it invoked in me?

- Made me want to search far and wide for assets as opposed to liabilities which are all I have right now
- I've developed this notion of only financing my "wants" through other means than my full-time employment income
- Pushed me to gain more streams of income
- Made me want to stop spending in silly places and take time to become financially literate by the definitions of the book
- Made me want to generalize and spend money to learn as many new and broad things as opposed to specializing
- Made me realize I think like a loser a lot
- Put into perspective that mistakes are required in order to make progress

###### Noteworthy Concepts

- Generalize, don't specialize, go deep and broad
- The four facets to financial literacy
- Financial aptitude
- A winner's and loser's mentality
- Importance of working to learn, not working to earn
- How traditional education rewards less mistakes and how that ultimately hurts those "A" students

###### Who and when I think you should read this

- Anytime in life, but the earlier the better!
- I think this is required reading for everyone
- If you need encouragement pursuing an untraditional path
- If you want to have your wits about you when it comes to money
- If you are a frivolous spender and are ready to be put in your place lol
- If you consider yourself an "A" student but you still feel lost when it comes to money
- If you've been brought up with the expectation of getting a good education and stable career in order to be successful
