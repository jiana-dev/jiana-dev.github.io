#### Overall Impression

Feel-good book that will make you feel like you're worth it and you have someone to relate to in Jen Sincero. A concise combination of concepts from Think & Grow Rich and other self help books with a modern twist. Spiritual aspect but communicated in a way that makes it less woo-woo. Tons of gold mine book recommendations at the end.

#### What it Invoked In Me

Makes you want to do the self-work. Drills in the idea of tuning in your frequency to match that of the limitless power of our higher being. Light-hearted feel with some very heavy-hitting statements. Makes you want to keep reading with each chapter because each one gives you general good advice and makes you feel so delightful by the end.

Anytime but especially if you're feeling down on yourself. May be a repetition of concepts from other books but well worth the overlap.
