&emsp;Each time I sat in the car driving to and from my parents' place, I cranked up the volume, turned on cruise control, and basked in the delight of feeling more seen, understood, and at peace with myself than ever before.

&emsp;Imagine reading a book that not only explains, but empowers you in traits you previously regarded as hinderances to your life—to your social development especially. Imagine then receiving the tools and guidance to be able to work with yourself, instead of fighting against yourself for not being like your extroverted counterparts. This book is the anthem for all introverts and if you've ever beat yourself up over things about yourself that you feel aren't in your control, please do yourself a solid and read this book!

&emsp;I don't have many friends anymore. I religiously avoid eye contact when I see acquaintances in a common place. I am compelled to reject every social invitation I am invited to, which at this point in life is none. As soon as there is more than one person involved in the social situation, I'm already thinking of ways out. And sometimes *even* with just one, if it's not my best friend of all time. I never stay committed to any social committee or position that involves regular meetings of greater than one person. I used to do everything in my power not to say hi to the guests my parents brought over. At social events, I am constantly watching the time for when I can leave, and if I'm there with someone social, well, God bless my soul. You hang in there, girl! I would much rather look busy with something so no one talks to me than engage in small talk.

&emsp;All of my report cards from JK to Grade 5 said something along the lines of "She's quiet, reserved, shy. Smart girl, but doesn't talk much." I can't tell you how many times I've heard something on the lines of "You have great ideas, just wish you would speak up and share them more often!"

&emsp;Lunch social events? A nightmare. Not only do I not get a "break", but I have to exert extra effort just to keep up? Or be a fly on the wall for a conversation I have no opinion about? I feel like I need a lunch break after that kind of lunch break. A perfect lunch break to me is sitting by myself watching a show. Or I *guess* having a conversation with someone I've found a comfort zone with. But I'd still rather be alone.

&emsp;Don't get me wrong it wasn't all like this. From Grade 6 to my third year in unversity, I was able to keep my introvertedness at bay just enough to gain a group of friends and get a few jobs to advance my career. It's not like I was severely crippled by my introvertedness, but at times, I couldn't help but think "*What's wrong with me?*"

&emsp;This book made me realize that as an introvert, my sensitivity is **not** something to be shamed for. I'm not overreacting and getting butt-hurt over "small deals". When my more extroverted partner reacts to something with an intensity in expression, especially when it comes to anger, it is **not** that I've done something I should feel terribly guilty for.

&emsp;As an introvert, it's also **not** that I'm less socially adept. Exposure to new stimuli just affects me greater. It's **not** that I am bad at reading social cues, I'm bad at handling multiple streams of stimulating activity at once. I can't self-monitor, read the other person, as well as keep up with small talk simultaneously. Even the thought is exhausting.

&emsp;It's **not** that I'm somewhat of a snob looking only to have deep conversations with select people and resisting the small talk required to get to know others. I just find it more natural to connect with people on a deeper level. I prefer intellectual conversation over ones that ultimately feel meaningless. I want to get to know your struggles, passions, dreams, lessons, feelings. And if I feel like I can't talk about those with you, I don't feel like we can build a relationship where I can feel comfortable talking in a 1-1 setting with you.

&emsp;It's okay that I'm not the best improv speaker and I struggle with communicating on the spot. I work best when I can take the time to prepare. I work best when I can do my research independently, and get the time to prepare a proper presentation that truly highlights the depth and intensity of my thoughts on a subject.

&emsp;I was still able to land jobs, do spontaneous and adventurous things, and meet new people in the past because introverts can personify as extroverts for things that truly matter to them. For me, those were things like success in my career, and being (what I thought at the time) was "cool". I likely scored high in "self-monitoring" during this time. Self-monitoring is a term used in the book to mean the ability and will for someone to modify how they are perceived by others. After moving schools, I was able to train and control this muscle even more as I was given a blank slate. No one knew I was the "shy girl". Maybe this is also why I loved travel so much. A chance to try on a new skin of a more extroverted variety.

&emsp;I learned that I needed to create more restorative niches for myself. This COVID-all-remote-work thing has done wonders for me in this regard. I can be in my restorative niche at all times. At the office, I never really thought too much about how I felt about the open concept, but I would have much preferred a private cubicle to allow me somewhere to retreat back after a hard day of socialization.

&emsp;Learning about restorative niches explained why I would ask for a bathroom break in between interview rounds even when I didn't need to go.

&emsp;Quiet by Susan Cain is truly my anthem, and I think it would be yours too if you find yourself feeling anything similar to what I've described. There's a lot more when it comes to this topic that I haven't really discussed, but I have a feeling this isn't my last time reading this book.

&emsp;All in all, this book did a lot for me, but mostly it made me feel comfortable being in my own skin. I can now say I'm an introvert and proud. When I compare myself to others, I can consider whether or not I perceive this person as an intro or extrovert and bake that into the equation so as not to expect the impossible from myself. I can understand that a quiet leader is just as effective as a loud one, and in some cases, more. Quiet does not mean "less than" in any category.

&emsp;I am an introspective, self-reflective, inquisitive, sensitive introvert, and I don't need to be anything else. I love the qualities I've inherited from my introversion.  I feel equipped not to impose beliefs that push my future children towards extroversion and away from their true selves just to fit in. I will continue to allow my introvertedness to shine where I please, and my extrovertedness to blossom in areas I value. So thank you, Susan Cain, for teaching me that everything I already am is more than enough. The fire that burns within me can be on a torch— but is equally effective in a lantern. As long as I'm letting the light shine, I'm going to be A-okay.

&emsp;I know I say every book changes my life, but Quiet by Susan Cain now holds a very near and dear place in my heart.
