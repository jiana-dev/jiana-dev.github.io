I know it's too soon to say, as I pretty much say this about every book I last relate to, but this book is one of my favourite books of all time. 

It gives me the power to write my name in the wet cement and leave my tip in a trail logbook. It allows me to convey meaning through a few carefully chosen words as opposed to my usual verbose rambles. It will allow me to not be so nervous attending a dinner party and be more confident in the skill of entertaining people. The superpower of storytelling enables me to become a better speaker, listener, writer, presenter, partner. 

I've documented my entire life since 2006 and I have tons of unorganized footage that I didn't know what to do with until now. Now, I have a treasure chest full of stories to find and apply the learnings of this book to. I have stories waiting to be written to capture my life and share with my children.

I can now look at each new day excited to uncover it's story. I have the power to understand myself better, and hopefully inspire others to do the same. I struggle with my purpose every day. But I shouldn't have been, because my whole life has been spent preparing for me reading this book. I'm sorry, that's dramatic but I mean it. If nothing else, my purpose is to tell my story. God knows I have a million up my sleeve, and now that I've read this book, I'm ready to uncover a million more.

I used to wonder why anyone would care about my stories, my life, my experiences if they don't even know me. But now I have the tools to craft my stories in a way I never thought to do before. I feel equipped to write my stories to inspire, to motivate, and to relate. It's gonna be tough for me to perfect, but I haven't been this excited about anything since discovering coding. So let's see where this one goes. 

P.S. I have my notes for this book that I took on Goodnotes based on [Jim Kwik's Note-Taking Method](https://jimkwik.com/kwik-brain-013/). I found this note-taking method really useful, and will be posting my notes for the books I read here from now on.
