##### **What is it about?**


Cal Newport presents a philosophy where one incorporates the minimal use of technology to enhance meaning in our lives, rather than determine it. He brings to light the hidden impact of our current digital world. He emphasizes the overwhelming benefits of adopting digital minimalism and the profound impact it has had on those who have adopted the philosophy. He also gives an interesting suggestion for a re-connection to analog activity and it's importance.

##### **What it Invoked In Me**

- As a developer, gave me food for thought on a "code of ethics" when thinking about developing applications
- Invoked in me an unspoken commitment to bring true and single value to peoples' lives should I attempt to do so through technology
- Gave me a reason to not always want to be "plugged in", receiving input, in front of a screen
- Prompted thought about developing my own technology philosophy
- Made me very aware of the danger of distraction a seemingly harmless piece of technology can elicit
- Gave me a reason to favour analog activity and developing a craft, even though it is not improving my general intellectual quotient
- Realization about the importance of social interaction
- Invoked deeper thinking on my bias for technology - Which areas can I limit technology to promote more positivity?

##### **Noteworthy Concepts**

- Computers can do so much, they have no longer become a single-use application and that's what has turned them into greater dangers in our lives
- Connection vs. Conversation
  - Phone office hours
- Solitude
- High-quality leisure
- We are not meant to have connection with so many people
  - Social approval nuggets

##### **Who and When You Should Read This**

- If you're surrounded by technology 24/7, glued to a screen, but don't necessarily want to be
- If technology is a gigantic part of your life and you don't think you could live without it, but you realize it does distract you
- Social media addicts who want to break the habit/addiction
- If you're a developer, this will give you a nice code of ethics that you might not want to hear when it comes to making the big bucks, but important when it comes to making the world better, or perhaps just not making it worse
