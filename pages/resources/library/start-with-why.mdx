This is a collection of quotes and some of my own paraphrasing that really spoke to me from the book. My reflection notes can be found [here](/blog/start-with-why).

## Key Ideas

### On Leaders

> Leaders hold a position of power or influence and those who lead inspire us

> Great leaders and great organizations are good at seeing what most of us can’t see. They are good at giving us things we would never think of asking for.

> The role of a leader is not to come up with all the great ideas. The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen.

> “She’s a great leader because she understands that earning the trust of an organization doesn’t come from setting out to impress everyone, it comes from setting out to serve those who serve her. It is the invisible trust that gives a leader the following they need to get things done.”

>  “All leaders must have two things: they must have a vision of the world that does not exist and they must have the ability to communicate it.”
>
> ...
>
> “Leaders don’t have all the great ideas; they provide support for those who want to contribute. Leaders achieve very little by themselves; they inspire people to come together for the good of the group. ”
>
> Leaders start with WHY we need to do things. Leaders inspire action.



### On Manipulation vs. Inspiration

> If companies don't know why their customers are their customers, odds are good that they don’t know why their employees are their employees either.

> “When companies or organizations do not have a clear sense of why their customers are their customers, they tend to rely on a disproportionate number of manipulations to get what they need. And for good reason. Manipulations work.”

#### In Marketing

> “If a customer feels inspired to buy a product, rather than manipulated, they will be able to verbalize the reasons why they think what they bought is better”

> “If a company does not have a clear sense of WHY then it is impossible for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary currency of differentiation.”



### On Innovation vs. Novelty

> “Real innovation changes the course of industries or even society. The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine, iTunes. These are true innovations that changed how we conduct business, altered how we live our lives...”



### The Golden Circle

#### Definitions

> ​	Before we can explore its applications, let me first define the terms, starting from the outside of the circle and moving inward.
>
> ​	WHAT: Every single company and organization on the planet knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no matter what industry. Everyone is easily able to describe the products or services a company sells or the job function they have within that system. WHATs are easy to identify.
>
> ​	HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether you call them a “differentiating value proposition,” “proprietary process” or “unique selling proposition,” HOWs are often given to explain how something is different or better. Not as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the differentiating or motivating factors in a decision. It would be false to assume that’s all that is required. There is one missing detail:
>
> ​	WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don’t mean to make money—that’s a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?
>
> ​	When most organizations or people think, act or communicate they do so from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good reason—they go from clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say WHY we do WHAT we do.

#### In Marketing

> “When communicating from the inside out, however, the WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as the tangible proof of that belief”

#### On Adapting within the Industry

> “Instead of asking, “WHAT should we do to compete?” the questions must be asked, “WHY did we start doing WHAT we’re doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?”



### On "I feel it in my gut"

> “The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no capacity for language. It is this disconnection that makes putting our feelings into words so hard.”

It's not just about being funny or smart, there are tons of funny and smart people. We don't want to marry all of them. Our explanation isn't based on rationality. It just "feels right" sometimes.

This also goes for other decisions. When a decision feels right, we have a hard time explaining why we did what we did. These are "gut decisions", they just feel right. It's actually happening in the **limbic brain** though. But the reason gut decisions feel right is because the part of the brain that controls them also controls our feelings.

#### On Our Limbic Brain

> “When you force people to make decisions with only the rational part of their brain, they almost invariably end up “overthinking.”

> “Our limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It is our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not to.”

#### On companies that only appeal to our rational brains

> “Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY force us to make decisions with only empirical evidence. This is why those decisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain”

> “This is what we mean when we talk about winning hearts and minds. The heart represents the limbic, feeling part of the brain, and the mind is the rational, language center.”

> “Absent a WHY, a decision is harder to make. And when in doubt we look to science, to data, to guide decisions.”



### On Clarity, Discipline and Consistency

> “For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. It’s not “integrity,” it’s “always do the right thing.” It’s not “innovation,” it’s “look at the problem from a different angle.” Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea . . . we have a clear idea of how to act in any situation. ”

> “Without WHY, any attempt at authenticity will almost always be inauthentic.”



#### Three Degrees of Certainty

When we can only rely on rational basis for a decision - "I *think* this is the right decision". What's happening when we debate between pros and cons.

When we make gut decisions - "The decision *feels* right", even if it flies in the face of the facts and figures. Not scalable because it can only be made by a single person.

BUT

When you know your why - "I *know* it's right"



#### In business

Previously would think customer is always right, but it depends. The goal of the business shouldn't be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe. When you're selective, trust emerges



### On the Emergence of Trust

#### On working in a company

> “The same can be said for any place that has a strong culture or recognizable personality. We do better in cultures in which we are good fits. We do better in places that reflect our own values and beliefs. Just as the goal is not to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have, but to do business with people who believe what you believe, so too is it beneficial to live and work in a place where you will naturally thrive because your values and beliefs align with the values and beliefs of that culture.”

> “Their ability to find people who embody their cause makes it much easier for them to provide great service. As Herb Kelleher famously said, “You don’t hire for skills, you hire for attitude. You can always teach skills.”

> “Great companies don’t hire skilled people and motivate them, they hire already motivated people and inspire them. ”

> Unless you give motivated people something to believe in, something bigger than their job to work toward, they will motivate themselves to find a new job and you’ll be stuck with whoever’s left”

> “Companies with a strong sense of WHY are able to inspire their employees. Those employees are more productive and innovative, and the feeling they bring to work attracts other people eager to work there as well”
>
> ...
>
> “In these organizations, from the management on down, no one sees themselves as any more or any less than anyone else. They all need each other.”

No trust => no risks => no exploration => no experimentation and no advancement of society as a whole. When people trust culture or organization, they will take personal risks in order to advance that culture or organization as a whole.



#### Trust at home

Trust is why we are more likely to choose a babysitter from the neighbourhood with little reviews vs. one found online with thousands of good ones. You have the idea that they share some of the same principles and ideals as you simply because they belong to a same group as yours.



#### On who comes first - shareholder or employees

> “When a journalist asked Kelleher who comes first to him, his shareholders or his employees, his response was heresy at the time (and to a large degree still is). “Well, that’s easy,” he said, “employees come first and if employees are treated right, they treat the outside world right, the outside world uses the company’s product again, and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it works and it’s not a conundrum at all.”



### On the Tipping Point

All companies have the point where their business or spreading of an idea starts moving at an extraordinary pace. When an idea becomes a movement. At this point, the goal should be to find people who believe what you believe. The left side of the bell curve.

<ImageWithCaption src="../images/start-with-why/00006.gif" alt="Simon Sinek Curve" caption="Simon Sinek's Curve of customers" small/>

They perceive greater value in what you do and will happily pay a premium or suffer some sort of inconvenience to be a part of  your cause.

These are the people who will see WHY they need to incorporate your products into their lives and not only love you but talk about you. Getting enough of the left side people encourages the rest to follow.

Aiming at the middle of the curve is so expensive.

How do you get more people to "get it"? Moore refers to as the "chasm" the transition between early adopters and early majority which is hard to cross unless you know WHY.

At this point you won't need to incentivize because the people who love you will just talk about you, if they truly believe in what you believe.



### Start With Why, but Know How

> “WHY-types are focused on the things most people can’t see, like the future. HOW-types are focused on things most people can see and tend to be better at building structures and processes and getting things done. ”

Neither is better than the other, they are just different. But every why-person needs it's how-person. Gates is a why, Write brothers are why's, Jobs, Kelleher. But they all needed their HOWs.

Most people are HOW-types. HOWs can fare well, but they won't build billion-dollar businesses or change the world. WHY-types for all their vision and imagination often get the short end of the stick.

> “Without someone inspired by their vision and the knowledge to make it a reality, most WHY-types end up as starving visionaries, people with all the answers but never accomplishing much themselves.”

Most successful entrepreneurs are HOW even though they might think they are visionaries. They'll tell you they love to build things - and that's a sure clue they know HOW.

Special partnership between one who knows WHY and those who know HOW. The vision of the future and the talent to get it done that makes an organization great.

Vision statements - WHY

Mission statements - HOW



### Know Why, Know How, Then What?

Leader's role changes as a company grows, he is no longer the loudest part of the megaphone, he is the source of the message that is to flow through the megaphone.



### Communication is Not About Speaking, It's About Listening

With no WHY, a logo is just a logo. People who get logos tattooed on themselves show us they were inspired and a part of spoke to who they are.

We look to others to improve HOW and WHAT we do. But the problem with this is:

> “We are in pursuit of understanding the best practices of others to help guide us. But it is a flawed assumption that what works for one organization will work for another. Even if the industries, sizes and market conditions are the same, the notion that “if it’s good for them, it’s good for us” is simply not true.”

In comes the Celery Test metaphor.



### When Why Goes Fuzzy

The split happens with success. Theres a difference between being successful vs. feeling successful and guess what it is?

> “achievement comes when you pursue and attain WHAT you want. Success comes when you are clear in pursuit of WHY you want it.”

> “Success comes when we wake up every day in that never-ending pursuit of WHY we do WHAT we do. Our achievements, WHAT we do, serve as the milestones to indicate we are on the right path. It is not an either/or—we need both”

When we build a business or career, we gain confidence in WHAT we do, and experts in HOW to do it, and each achievement is a tangible measurement of success and feelings of progress increase. But most of us somewhere along the line forget WHY we set out on the journey in the first place. This is called the **split**.



### Split Happens

Small business fail because passion alone can't cut it. Passion needs structure to survive, but for structure to grow, it needs passion.

Companies may start with WHY but as they grow more successful, WHAT comes first and systems/processes are in pursuit of those tangible results.

"Returning to basics" alludes to a time before the split, when the WHAT was in perfect parallel to WHY.

Value is a feeling, not a calculation. It is perception.

> “When people know WHY you do WHAT you do, they are willing to give you credit for everything that could serve as proof of WHY. When they are unclear about your WHY, WHAT you do has no context. Even though the things you do or decisions you make may be good, they won’t make sense to others without a clear understanding of WHY.”



### On the Origins of Why

> “The WHY does not come from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born out of any market research. It does not come from extensive interviews with customers or even employees. It comes from looking in the completely opposite direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a process of discovery, not invention.”

The hard part is not gaining clarity of WHY, it's the discipline to trust your gut, stay true to your purpose, cause or beliefs. Remaining completely in balance and authentic.

> “When I looked back to my upbringing, I discovered a remarkable theme. Whether among friends, at school or professionally, I was always the eternal optimist. I was the one who inspired everyone to believe they could do whatever they wanted. This pattern is my WHY. To inspire”



### The New Competition

> “What if the next time when someone asks, “Who’s your competition?” we replied, “No idea.” What if the next time someone pushes, “Well, what makes you better than your competition?” we replied, “We’re not better than them in all cases.” And what if the next time someone asks, “Well why should I do business with you then?" we answer with confidence, “Because the work we’re doing now is better than the work we were doing six months ago. And the work we’ll be doing six months from now will be better than the work we’re doing today. Because we wake up every day with a sense of WHY we come to work. We come to work to inspire people to do the things that inspire them. Are we better than our competition? If you believe what we believe and you believe that the things we do can help you, then we’re better. If you don’t believe what we believe and you don’t believe the things we can do will help you, then we’re not better. Our goal is to find customers who believe what we believe and work together so that we can all succeed. We’re looking for people to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us in pursuit of the same goal. We’re not interested in sitting across a table from each other in pursuit of a sweeter deal. And here are the things we’re doing to advance our cause . . .” And then the details of HOW and WHAT you do follow. But this time, it started with WHY.





## Analogies and Anecdotes

### Japanese vs. American Car Manufacturer on Car Doors

> “So many organizations function in a world of tangible goals and the mallets to achieve them. The ones that achieve more, the ones that get more out of fewer people and fewer resources, the ones with an outsized amount of influence, however, build products and companies and even recruit people that all fit based on the original intention. Even though the outcome may look the same, great leaders understand the value in the things we cannot see.”



### Apple

#### On iTunes

> “in the case of iTunes, challenged an industry to completely reevaluate its business model.”



#### On the iPhone

> “Removing all the buttons and putting a touch screen is not what makes the iPhone innovative, however. Those are brilliant new features. But others can copy those things and it wouldn’t redefine the category. There is something else that Apple did that is vastly more significant.
> Apple is not only leading how mobile phones are designed, but, in typical Apple fashion, also how the industry functions. In the mobile phone industry, it is the service provider, not the phone manufacturer, that determines all the features and benefits the phone can offer”



#### On Marketing

##### WHAT, HOW, CALL TO ACTION

> We make great computers.
>
> They're beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly.
>
> Wanna buy one?

###### WHY, HOW, WHAT, CALL TO ACTION

> Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently.
> The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.
>
> And we happen to make great computers.
>
> Wanna buy one?



#### What makes it special

> “Simply copying WHAT Apple does or HOW it does it won’t work. There is something more, something hard to describe and near impossible to copy that gives Apple such a disproportionate level of influence in the market”



#### "Apple is a lifestyle brand"

> “In the business world, they say Apple is a lifestyle brand. They underestimate Apple’s power. Gucci is a lifestyle brand—Apple changes the course of industries. By any definition these few companies don’t function like corporate entities. They exist as social movements.”



#### Before Apple

Even before Apple. Wozniak and Jobs were making things that challenged the status quo. Blue Box - they liked the idea of giving other individuals the ability to avoid having to play by the rules of monopolistic forces.



### Examples of Novelty

The Motorola RAZR - Features added in an attempt to differentiate, but not reinvent. Not bad, but can't be counted on to add long-term value.

Colgate and it's thousands of variations of toothpastes



### The Cathedral Example

> “You walk up to the first stonemason and ask, “Do you like your job?” He looks up at you and replies, “I’ve been building this wall for as long as I can remember. The work is monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be backbreaking. I’m not even sure if this project will be completed in my lifetime. But it’s a job. It pays the bills.”

> “About thirty feet away, you walk up to a second stonemason. You ask him the same question, “Do you like your job?” He looks up and replies, “I love my job. I’m building a cathedral. Sure, I’ve been working on this wall for as long as I can remember, and yes, the work is sometimes monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be backbreaking. I’m not even sure if this project will be completed in my lifetime. But I’m building a cathedral.”

WHAT these two stonemasons are doing is exactly the same; the difference is, one has a sense of purpose. He feels like he belongs, he comes to work to be part of something bigger than the job he's doing.



### Langley vs. The Wright Brothers Example

Langley wanted to be the first man to fly. His purpose was to be rich and famous.

The Wright brothers had a dream to fly because they knew it would change the world. They knew the benefits to everyone else if they were successful.

Langley was looking for achievement, he did not have the Wrights' passion for flight. Both were trying to build the same thing, but their motivations were different.

When the Wright brothers achieved their goal, Langley gave up. He got out of the business. He could have said, "That's amazing, now I'm going to improve upon their technology". This proved he was only motivated by WHAT. He found the defeat humiliating.



### Trust and The Trapeze Artist

> “There is big a difference between jumping out of a plane with a parachute on and jumping without one. Both produce extraordinary experiences, but only one increases the likelihood of being able to try again another time. A trapeze artist with a personality predisposed to taking extraordinary risks without a net may be the star attraction in an otherwise mediocre show. But if he dies or leaves for another circus, then what? This is the paradigm in which someone is motivated by self-gain regardless of the consequences or the benefits to the organization for which he or she works.”

> “Great organizations become great because the people inside the organization feel protected. The strong sense of culture creates a sense of belonging and acts like a net. ”



### TiVo's Marketing Mistakes

#### What they did

>  We’ve got a new product.
> It pauses live TV.
> Skips commercials.
> Rewinds live TV.
>
> Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without your needing to set it.”

#### If they had started with why

> “If you’re the kind of person who likes to have total control of every aspect of your life, boy do we have a product for you.
> It pauses live TV.
> Skips commercials.
> Rewinds live TV.
> Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf without you needing to set it.”



### Martin Luther King

> “And in the summer of 1963, a quarter of a million people showed up to hear Dr. King deliver his “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
> But how many people showed up for Dr. King?
> Zero.
> They showed up for themselves. It was what they believed. It was what they saw as an opportunity to help America become a better version of itself.”

> “More than anything else, what Martin Luther King Jr. gave us was clarity, a way to explain how we felt. He gave us the words that inspired us. He gave us something to believe in, something we could easily share with our friends.”



### Walt Disney — Why vs. How

> “Roy was always in awe of his brother’s talent and imagination, but he also knew that Walt was prone to taking risks and to neglecting business affairs. Like all WHY guys, Walt was busy thinking about what the future looked like and often forget he was living in the present. “Walt Disney dreamed, drew and imagined, Roy stayed in the shadow, forming an empire,” ”



### The Celery Test

A metaphor for a way to find out exactly WHAT and HOW is right for you, since looking to others will just not cut it since everyone is different.

> “Imagine you go to a dinner party and somebody comes up to you and says, “You know what you need in your organization? M&M’s. If you’re not using M&M’s in your business, you’re leaving money on the table.”
> Somebody else comes up to you and says, “You know what you need? Rice milk. The data shows that all the people are buying rice milk these days. You should be selling rice milk in this economy.”
> While you’re standing over the punch bowl, yet another person offers some sage advice. “Oreo cookies,” he says. “We made millions from implementing Oreo cookies in our organization. You’ve got to do it.”
> Still somebody else comes up to you and says, “Celery. You’ve got to get into celery.”
> You get all this great advice from all these highly accomplished people. Some of them are in the same industry. Some of them are more successful than you. Some of them have offered similar advice to others with great success. Now, what do you do?
> You go to the supermarket and you buy celery, rice milk, Oreos and M&M’s. You spend a lot of time at the supermarket walking the aisles. You spend a lot of money because you buy everything. But you may or may not get any value from some or all of these products; there are no guarantees. Worse, if you’re budget-constrained, you had to whittle down your choices again. And then which do you choose?”
>
>
>
> “But one thing’s for sure: when you’re standing in line at the supermarket with all of these items in your arms, your celery, rice milk, Oreos and M&Ms, nobody can see what you believe. What you do is supposed serve as the tangible proof of what you believe, and you bought everything.
> But what if you knew your WHY before you went to the supermarket? What if your WHY is to do only things that are healthy? To always do the things that are good for your body? You’ll get all the same good advice from all the same people, the only difference is, the next time you go to the supermarket, you’ll buy only rice milk and celery. Those are the only products that make sense. It’s not that the other advice isn’t good advice, it’s just not good for you. The advice doesn’t fit.”

FIltering your decisions through your why allows you to spend less time at the supermarket, spend less money. And **everyone can see what you believe.**

"I can *see* that you believe in looking after your health. I feel the same way. I have a question for you."

This is an example of communicating your WHY based on WHAT you do.

But what about when I just want a chocolate cake? What about when we need to make short-term decisions to pay bills or get some short-term advantage?

It's fine. As long as you know it's just that, a short-term decision.

> “Starting with WHY not only helps you know which is the right advice for you to follow, but also to know which decisions will put you out of balance. You can certainly make those decisions if you need to, but don’t make too many of them, otherwise over time, no one will know what you believe.”

> “As soon as I told you the WHY, you knew that we were going to buy only celery and rice milk even before you read it. As soon as I gave you the filter, as soon as I said the WHY, you knew exactly what decisions to make before I said so.
> That’s called scale.
> With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the organization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for decision-making. Any decisions—hiring, partnerships, strategies and tactics—should all pass the Celery Test.



### Ben Comen

The boy who ran the race with cerebral palsy.

> “When everybody else is done with their race, everyone comes back to run with Ben. Ben is the only runner who, when he falls, someone else will help pick him up. Ben is the only runner who, when he finishes, has a hundred people running behind him.
> What Ben teaches us is special. When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.

> “All organizations start with WHY, but only the great ones keep their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget WHY they were founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else instead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for those who lose sight of WHY they are running the race, is for the medal or to beat someone else.”
