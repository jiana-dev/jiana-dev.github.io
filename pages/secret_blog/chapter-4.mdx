  <h2 className="lead">Truth be told, I wanted this series to feel more impactful when I began it.</h2> 
  <p>But I realize that perhaps I should have named it &quot;How Breaking My Negative Addictions Changed My Life&quot;.</p>
  <p>I wanted to emphasize this girl who had her entire identity confused, and then very slowly, went back on the journey to find it. Along the way I think I skipped too many details, or I didn&#39;t hone in deep enough in certain areas that I should have.</p>
  <p>But a part of me doesn&#39;t feel the need to write it all down because I think I could convey it in a video or perhaps another medium in a much clearer way. I have documented most of my life for a very long time and I think a future project of mine will involve putting it all together in some artistic fashion.</p>
  <p>Maybe I&#39;ll revisit this and try to write it again, but for now, I&#39;ll try to salvage this with some sort of conclusive ending.</p>
  <p>We left off Chapter 3 at &quot;Level One&quot; as I&#39;d called it. I had taken the steps to take back control of my body, meaning what was left was my mind, and my spirituality.</p>
  <p>I knew no other way to nourish my mind than books. Being out of school, there was no <em>forced</em> learning, which a part of me actually missed. Anyhow, I loved reading as a little girl but had never really picked it back up as a hobby since entering my teens. <em>Oh, the knowledge I now feel I have missed out on.</em></p>
  <p>I started with a recommendation a dear friend had given me a long time ago, called <em>The Happiness Equation, by Neil Pasricha</em>. Reading this book had me hooked on self-improvement. My mind was buzzing with all of these &quot;new&quot; fundamental, common-sense, yet profound concepts being presented to me.</p>
  <p>The Happiness Equation was like a gateway drug for me. I branched into <em>How To Win Friends &amp; Influence People (Dale Carnegie), 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Stephen Covey), The 4-Hour Workweek (Tim Ferriss), Think and Grow Rich! (Napoleon Hill), Atomic Habits (James Clear), You are a Badass (Jen Sincero), The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success (Deepak Chopra)</em>. Each book just as good, if not better than the last, and each one awakening deeply dormant parts of me.</p>
  <p>Some messages in the books overlapped but they were all drilling some of the same fundamentally important concepts, and a few novel ones into my head. I&#39;ll get into this more in another blog post.</p>
  <p>I even started nurturing other facets of my knowledge and indulging my interests by reading <em>Clean Code (Robert C. Martin), The Pragmatic Programmer (Andrew Hunt, David Thomas), Problem Solving 101 (Ken Watanabe)</em>, and <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)</em>. These were the books that were improving my skills rather than aspects of my personality or revealing my true desires.</p>
  <p>Wow, who knew that I could start feeling more confident in my ability to code,  interact with others, and lead just by feeding my brain with a little nutrition.</p>
  <p>I also started bullet journalling in June 2020, and just overall starting to incorporate time for good habits that I never made time for before. I could see myself from an outside perspective becoming a more mature, well-rounded, self-aware, more confident, and just a smarter person overall.</p>
  <p>Just as my body was taking shape, so was my mind. That tiny percentage of effort every day turned into an undeniable substantial effect of improvement that occurred over the course of 2020.</p>
  <p>It feels like being on this trajectory has led me to exponential growth, and I&#39;m excited to see where it takes me.</p>
  <p>I truly don&#39;t mean to say this to brag about where I am now and how high and mighty I feel to be a book-reader, health-nut, I-spend-my-time-better-than-you person. I&#39;m just truly amazed by what little changes and small efforts can compound to over the course of a year. And dare I say it, but I&#39;m proud of myself.</p>
  <p>I still have a long way to go. In fact, sure, scratching this surface has propelled me by leaps and bounds, but it was only to show me that those leaps and bounds are miniscule compared to the vast infinity that has been revealed to lie ahead of me.</p>
  <p>Everyday, I&#39;m just trying to work it out, do my best, and get better, but there are still so many core questions and confusions I have. And that&#39;s why this next phase of life, my current phase, is to attempt to figure it all out.</p>
