| 04/21/21 | "Stephen, why are you so much funnier these days?" "I'm not funnier, you just love me more" |
| 04/22/21 | Got parents getaway at Tiny Home for their anniversary weekend. Ends up being source of frustration â€” what about the cats? No internet? Dad needs to work. Pretty sad and disappointed.<hr/>"I'm thinking about doing therapy" - Easily one of the happiest moments of my life.<hr/>A girl! Finally, a fellow female! Found my video not just helpful but <em>so</em> helpful. I'm over the moon. <hr/> Anniversary-turned spontaneous girls trip.|
| 04/23/21 | A heart-to-heart with my camera on a long drive after finishing Quiet<hr/>Mom and Jiana take on a play- I mean tiny home.|
| 04/24/21 | Tiny marsh transports us into a different world. Mom only learned dad was sensitive halfway into their relationship. |
| 04/25/21 | Mom realizes she might not remember anything because she never lives in the present. Only the future and the past. |
| 04/26/21 | She listens to a Megan Batoon podcast and wants to get more knowledgeable about her Filipino culture.<hr/>Mom and I listen to Gmorning Gnight and it's all I want to play for my kids each morning and night. |
| 04/27/21 | I'm feeling blue. I'm living in the future, in a post-COVID world. Travelling the world and only doing things I love. I dream. |
| 04/28/21 | I want to be a nomad for a month. He doesn't. I want to talk about dreams and be hopeful. He wants to bring me back down to Earth. I'm whimsical, spontaneous, slightly insane, and a travel bug. He's logical, content, and enjoys life in his home. <hr/> It's not that. He just wants to do things with me because he loves me. I want to do things in general because I'm young and we're not married yet. |
| 04/29/21 | It's not about me. It's about how your partner feels right now, and it can be about your self-discoveries that caused the behaviour later. <hr/> Best friend talks for the soul. My first form of therapy. We uncover that my life of restrictions may be a cause for my way of doing things without consulting or permission, even though I don't need to have that behaviour anymore. |
| 04/30/21 | I'm all over the place with my communication, and I love that my best friend and I can talk that way, but it doesn't mean it needs to be like that with everyone I love. Or does it? |
| 05/01/21 | Why don't you think you're worth it? I should be spending my money in ways that make me happy. I should allow myself to level up so that I can flourish, even if that means spending what I make from my day job. Talks with Stephen on Waterloo walks. <hr/> Melissa and Jiana get too caught up in fantasy-land and come out of it with nothing. Lockdown absolutely sucks. COVID really sucks the planning and fun out of life. <hr/> It's May 1st and I feel like I've done nothing in 2021. |
| 05/02/21 | "We're a team, go do what you want to do and we can get to cleaning and building our workbench later." :) |
| 05/03/21 | After spending the whole evening with Stephen, I realize there are equal if not more important things than working on my Youtube channel or projects. <hr/> I watch Brit Marling's interview on Off Camera, and a TEDx talk on Figuring out what you want. I spend the whole day avoiding coding but enjoying my 1-1's. As an introvert, this surprises me. I wonder if I can be an engineering manager, or what it is I really want. I avoid thinking about it because I think it means veering to the side of no safety, and taking risks I'm not sure I am ready to take. I don't look back at old posts in fear of seeing I shouldn't be where I am right now. |
| 05/04/21 | I crave doing something else. If I spend my 9-5 on work, and my 5-9 with loved ones, I have no room for my truly desired work. How can everyday be made up of what I truly want? <hr/> Complete flow today developing the continued story video. Enjoyed going through footage and adding things that enhanced my story. I loved it. And I made it to the deadline of 5pm to spend quality time and did that *almost* wholeheartedly too. It was a good day. |
| 05/05/21 | Mental breakdown at work. I can't take it anymore, I can't be around passive aggressive, toxic people. I need a new job. I'm taking a personal day. But first let me do all my due diligence because that's just the type of person I am. <hr/> Stephen is my soothing presence, a partner through and through. Thank you, Stephen. |
| 05/06/21 | ANXIETY NEEDS STRUCTURE! <hr/> It's time to do what I do best. I am good at taking a collection of things and putting it together in a cohesive way. I need to do this for my freakin' business plan. |
| 05/07/21 | When I think about my core personal values, I thought I would need to do another deep reflection about it. Or do I? Perhaps I don't need to look any further than what I record daily in my bullet journal. Habits make us who we are, what I track daily makes me who I am! <hr/> Animal Farm Escape. So grounding. Love family time. |
| 05/08/21 | Soul friend car chats. Friend therapy! Need it, love it. I love that Melissa and I have literally the exact same underlying problems all the time and we can support each other through it. Relationships, work settings, anxiety. And we always have the most awesome food adventures and could talk for hours. <hr/> Playing Unravel Two with Justin so cute and perfect for us because he can save me when I mess up! Lol. |
| 05/09/21 | Feeling of overwhelming gratefulness to have my mom who's alive when driving by a cemetery on Mother's Day <hr/> Feeling sense of I should be doing something else right now is the worst feeling. Almost felt it yesterday when I was caught up looking through old footage instead of making the most of Mother's Day. <hr/> Just start the thing. Don't wanna garden at first but it felt rewarding and satisfying in the end. <hr/> Anything to foster family activity end up being a fun time. Rock smith with dad and Justin. |
| 05/10/21 | Realizing that I've been translating for Andy and it hasn't been helping, insecurity about how I conduct 1-1s. Am I too much? Am I planting ideas in their brains? <hr/> Rock smith with Justin. Unravel Two. LOL at my gaming skills. I just rely on Justin. <hr/> Speaking with Stephen - we haven't defined how we want to interact when I'm away an it's a point of contention. |
| 05/11/21 | Encourage a switch up for language towards Nemo. You are a strong boy. You are powerful. Not emphasizing anxiety, punishment for barking. Intrinsic psychological difference. <hr/> There's so much to learn from people who are where you want to be. More and more I'm seeing the value in having a sense of community. I ought to find and invest more time into this. <hr/> My first attempt at power-posing and practicing presence. Two nerve-wracking conversations with authority. Two coaching sessions. <hr/> Managing is problem-solving for a much more complex subject matter. People. <hr/> What comes naturally to me? What do I really love? That I could spend hours on? Right now, it's this people stuff -- coaching, learning about managing, leadership stuff. |
| 05/12/21 | I think I've been talking and gossipping too much. Not actually coaching. I've been inserting too much of my own advice. Thank God I'm reading this book. <hr/> Stephen sad because I bottled up my feelings about how I think he resents me when I'm in Markham and it exploded on him when he was excited to show me something. I really tried turning a new leaf and apologizing and comforting but it still bled into today. Is it healthy for me to completely absorb and mimic his emotions for the day? I tried in the morning to be a shining light but when I saw it wasn't working, my mood started to dip. Should all of my efforts be put towards resolving that? How does that play into my anxiety about not getting anything done and not moving the needle? I wasn't able to happily help him with his project because I had so many things on my mind I hadn't talked to him or caught up with him about yet. Am I making it about me? |
| 05/13/21 | Social interaction is becoming so much less daunting. I'm seeking it rather than hiding from it. Thank you remote life. <hr/> Spoke with Karen about her leaving. So eye-opening. <hr/> Coaching with Darcy is quite nice, but still thinking about how Ling could really help guide and shape me. <hr/> Austin Kleon interview with Jocelyn K. Glei while preparing lunch. Idea on adding constraints to myself to help facilitate creativity. Inspired by digital minimalism, analog creation. <hr/> Spoke to Stephen about what's been on my mind. Feels a lot better to say what I want than to say what I don't want. |
