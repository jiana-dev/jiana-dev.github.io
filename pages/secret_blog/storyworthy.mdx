| 04/21/21 | "Stephen, why are you so much funnier these days?" "I'm not funnier, you just love me more" |
| 04/22/21 | Got parents getaway at Tiny Home for their anniversary weekend. Ends up being source of frustration â€” what about the cats? No internet? Dad needs to work. Pretty sad and disappointed.<hr/>"I'm thinking about doing therapy" - Easily one of the happiest moments of my life.<hr/>A girl! Finally, a fellow female! Found my video not just helpful but <em>so</em> helpful. I'm over the moon. <hr/> Anniversary-turned spontaneous girls trip.|
| 04/23/21 | A heart-to-heart with my camera on a long drive after finishing Quiet<hr/>Mom and Jiana take on a play- I mean tiny home.|
| 04/24/21 | Tiny marsh transports us into a different world. Mom only learned dad was sensitive halfway into their relationship. |
| 04/25/21 | Mom realizes she might not remember anything because she never lives in the present. Only the future and the past. |
| 04/26/21 | She listens to a Megan Batoon podcast and wants to get more knowledgeable about her Filipino culture.<hr/>Mom and I listen to Gmorning Gnight and it's all I want to play for my kids each morning and night. |
| 04/27/21 | I'm feeling blue. I'm living in the future, in a post-COVID world. Travelling the world and only doing things I love. I dream. |
| 04/28/21 | I want to be a nomad for a month. He doesn't. I want to talk about dreams and be hopeful. He wants to bring me back down to Earth. I'm whimsical, spontaneous, slightly insane, and a travel bug. He's logical, content, and enjoys life in his home. <hr/> It's not that. He just wants to do things with me because he loves me. I want to do things in general because I'm young and we're not married yet. |
| 04/29/21 | It's not about me. It's about how your partner feels right now, and it can be about your self-discoveries that caused the behaviour later. <hr/> Best friend talks for the soul. My first form of therapy. We uncover that my life of restrictions may be a cause for my way of doing things without consulting or permission, even though I don't need to have that behaviour anymore. |
| 04/30/21 | I'm all over the place with my communication, and I love that my best friend and I can talk that way, but it doesn't mean it needs to be like that with everyone I love. Or does it? |
| 05/01/21 | Why don't you think you're worth it? I should be spending my money in ways that make me happy. I should allow myself to level up so that I can flourish, even if that means spending what I make from my day job. Talks with Stephen on Waterloo walks. <hr/> Melissa and Jiana get too caught up in fantasy-land and come out of it with nothing. Lockdown absolutely sucks. COVID really sucks the planning and fun out of life. <hr/> It's May 1st and I feel like I've done nothing in 2021. |
| 05/02/21 | "We're a team, go do what you want to do and we can get to cleaning and building our workbench later." :) |
| 05/03/21 | After spending the whole evening with Stephen, I realize there are equal if not more important things than working on my Youtube channel or projects. <hr/> I watch Brit Marling's interview on Off Camera, and a TEDx talk on Figuring out what you want. I spend the whole day avoiding coding but enjoying my 1-1's. As an introvert, this surprises me. I wonder if I can be an engineering manager, or what it is I really want. I avoid thinking about it because I think it means veering to the side of no safety, and taking risks I'm not sure I am ready to take. I don't look back at old posts in fear of seeing I shouldn't be where I am right now. |
| 05/04/21 | I crave doing something else. If I spend my 9-5 on work, and my 5-9 with loved ones, I have no room for my truly desired work. How can everyday be made up of what I truly want? <hr/> Complete flow today developing the continued story video. Enjoyed going through footage and adding things that enhanced my story. I loved it. And I made it to the deadline of 5pm to spend quality time and did that *almost* wholeheartedly too. It was a good day. |
| 05/05/21 | Mental breakdown at work. I can't take it anymore, I can't be around passive aggressive, toxic people. I need a new job. I'm taking a personal day. But first let me do all my due diligence because that's just the type of person I am. <hr/> Stephen is my soothing presence, a partner through and through. Thank you, Stephen. |
| 05/06/21 | ANXIETY NEEDS STRUCTURE! |
