  <h2 className="lead">It’s pretty funny to me that now that I’ve gotten a grasp on my life, it feels slipperier than ever.</h2>
  <p>In my pursuit of knowledge about life, about myself, I’ve found that the discovery zone is much larger than I had originally anticipated.</p>
  <p>I’ll approach this in the way I was taught by Ken Watanabe. First, let’s identify the problem. </p>
  <p>In the simplest of terms, I don’t know what I’m doing in life. I don’t know what it is I’m put on this Earth to do in the best, most unique, Jiana way that I can. I keep reading and every resource tells me that I will find that given the right tools, mindset, and persistence, but it’s hard to tell someone they’ll find their life raft in the middle of the ocean while they’re drowning.</p>
  <p>Now that we’ve identified the problem, let me tell you about the things I know about myself. We’re good at that, we can do that.</p>
  <p>I know that I want to be productive with my time. I know what coding fun projects that have personal meaning and purpose make me get lost in time. I know I love Youtube and have looked up to Youtube personalities all my life. I know I love documenting my entire life. I know I have a few skills like coding, documenting, organization that I could leverage in some way. I know I have to work on lots of things, especially when it comes to communication and timidness with others. </p>
  <p>Now here are the things I have learned to know and have been trying to apply since learning them. They are sometimes accompanied with a doubt.</p>
  <p>I know the most I can do right now is keep casting my fishing lines out consistently. This is what I’ve done in the past when I’ve been in Square Two (reference to Finding Your Own North Star) and it has always gotten me somewhere. <em>But what if I’m not using the right bait? How do I figure out what the right bait is?</em></p>
  <p>Sure I have a few skills, but who’s to say they’re anything special that will lead to anywhere that other people haven’t already fulfilled the need for. I want to say /Who am I to think I’m so special?/ but I already know that train of thought leads nowhere.</p>
  <p>I know I am on quite an exciting trajectory at my 9-5, and it is an opportunity I should be really excited about. But then why would I prefer to spend all my time creating content I think is cool and planting my seeds in the world? For virtually no money, by the way. In contrast to my amazingly stable, well-paying position right now.</p>
  <p>I know I need to focus on my deep desires and the power of the mind. I know that if I want something badly enough, I will acquire it (Think and Grow Rich) but what if I’m not good enough to get there? It’s almost like I leave this gap in my desire that allows me a contingency plan to switch or diverge if it looks like I won’t achieve what I set out for. Doesn’t that just defeat the purpose of a burning desire?</p>
  <p>I know I need to spend money to make money, but when it comes down to it, why don’t I care to invest in myself?</p>
  <p>I know I need to be patient, slow down, listen to my essential self (Finding Your Own North Star) long enough to not only be consistent in my target practice (Atomic Habits) but be accurate. But it’s just hard. However knowing it’s just part of the Change Cycle (FYONS) helps.</p>
  <p>I’ve defined what I wanted (through my Dreamliner, 4HWW) but it just feels like these things are so unattainable since they are primarily out of my control.</p>
  <p>And finally, here’s what it feels like.</p>
  <p>It feels like I need some stroke of luck and much, much, much more talent, and a more interesting personality (there I go again with the negativity feedback loop from hell) at that to even come close to getting what I want. But I know that luck is when preparation meets opportunity so I’ll keep chugging away. It’s just hard because I feel a long way from what I deem as being successful.</p>
  <p>Why do I feel like what I have to offer is never good enough? Or every app idea I have feels so daunting and like it’s been done better by someone else already? Is that fear and laziness talking or is that my essential self telling me maybe there’s a different, better path for me?</p>
  <p>I try so hard to think back at times when I was really successful and in tune with myself. Times in the past that I may have overlooked but were pretty proud moments. Like when I won the technology scholarship for the essay I wrote. Or when I befriended a person I truly looked up to. Or when I got a job in my field after my first year in university, and continued to move up in positions as the years went on. I try to use these as fuel to motivate me into thinking I can do anything.</p>
  <p>I know I can solve any problem, and I know I can do anything I want. I truly believe that. It’s just that the absence of instant gratification makes it hard for me to confirm that I’m on the right path.</p>
  <p>It feels like I’m in a rush, but I don’t know for what, and I don’t know how to go faster or which direction to go into. It feels like I’m sprinting full force into the darkness waiting for a smidgeon of light to peer through so I can latch on and run towards it.</p>
  <p>It’s just hard right now, and I’m far from figuring it all out, but I know I’ll get there.</p>
  <p>I went from being a sponge girl, to a normal girl, and now I’m on my way to becoming my version of a super girl, maybe even a cool girl! I know my analogies have been literally all over the place with this, but honestly, it’s a true representation of what’s going on in my brain all the time.</p>
  <p>Just being in the trenches right now, it’s hard to see that super girl on the other side. Then again, sponge girl never saw normal girl until she was her.</p>
  <p>So yeah, thanks for listening to my story. It’s only the beginning of what I hope to be a mosaic in a grand masterpiece.</p>
  <p>If you got here, I appreciate you. Truly, I do. You’re the nudge that brings me closer to super Jiana, and for that I am eternally grateful. I hope you’ll stick around, and I’ll let you know when I see her. </p>
  <p>Endless love,</p>
  <p>Jiana</p>
