###### What is it about?

- A book by the creator of index funds making his case about how index funds are superior to all!
- Half kidding, but it's mostly about the emphasis on the advantage over index funds to anything else with mathematical figures to back it up
- Sparked my interest to start looking into key numbers like P/E ratios for companies
- Pushed me to not want to participate in an actively managed mutual fund anymore

###### What it invoked in me?

- Sparked my interest to start looking into key numbers like P/E ratios for companies
- Pushed me to not want to participate in an actively managed mutual fund anymore

###### Noteworthy Concepts

- Impact of P/E ratio
- How fees make returns a lot less than they appear to be
- What speculative return does for overall investment returns (reversion to the mean)
- Yes, index funds will yield you the average return but it is far better than the infinitely worse alternative actions you could take
- Smart beta ETFs are more new-age, but might not be the best
- Use of many common investment terminology, price-earnings ratio, dividend yield, etc.

###### Who and when I think you should read this

- If you have a financial advisor, want to get more in depth about DIY investing, and need something to push you to move to index funds
- You want to get more comfortable with financial terms and concepts
