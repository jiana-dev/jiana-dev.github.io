###### What is it about?

- Getting your money in order step by step, beginning from the person in the worst shape possible (ex. huge credit card debts, no emergency savings)
- How to think about money and not make silly mistakes with it

###### What it invoked in me?

- Made me realize the things I've taken for granted with my money and be thankful for the lessons I've learned through my parents on managing it
- Was a good wake-up call on smaller things like spending extravagant amounts for things you don't need
- The preachiness of the audiobook, although at times was too much, was a nice fire under me for getting my finances together and it was enjoyable to listen to a professional speak about the topic in general

###### Noteworthy Concepts

- Debt snowball method
- Don't buy things you can't afford just out of ego (like a car)
- Importance of an emergency fund and keeping it separate from everything else
- Importance of investing for yourself and your kids
- Don't just pay off your home mortgage as fast as you can â€” a paid off house with no investments means you'll just have to sell the house in order to get by

###### Who and when I think you should read this

- I listened as an audiobook so my experience may be somewhat different
- Great if you are bad with money and don't have emergency funds, or are in deep debt
- Still good if you are in good financial shape to give you a guideline for how you should be thinking about money
- Has a very strong opinionated undertone but is still effective
