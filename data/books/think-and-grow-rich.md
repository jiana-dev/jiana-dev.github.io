#### Overall Impression

Acts like a life handbook to be referenced. Emphasis on your internal power. Can seem woo-woo at first but sticking with it proves well worth it by the end. Very unique concepts, ideas, and lists to refer back to. Almost like a textbook for life. Frequently referenced by many other self-improvement books (Atomic Habits, You are a Badass). Feels like one of the grandfather founders of self-help books.

#### What it Invoked In Me

Plants deep ideas into your mind that make you question if the author really knows what he's talking about. But with each chapter, that seed grows into something more powerful and you start truly believing that you can achieve anything you want if you follow the books' thirteen steps. Leaves you feeling winded, incredulous, but convinced at the same time. Also makes you aware of the driving force of different types of fears and allows you to catch yourself when you entertain them.



#### Who Should and When Should I Read This?

Maybe I have been convinced by the book to say this, but I believe this is something that could and should be taught in schools. Earlier awareness about these concepts will be highly beneficial to anyone who reads and internalizes this stuff.
