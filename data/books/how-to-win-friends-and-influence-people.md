#### Overall Impression

Great read on how to be outwardly likeable and "get your way" but not in a manipulative way. How to be the bigger person and communicate with others more effectively.

#### What it Invoked In Me

Makes you more others-centric in your communication with people. Helps you develop core people skills.



#### Who Should and When Should I Read This?

A good book, particularly for after you've done inner work. On the same playing field as 7 Habits and Happiness Equation with a focus on how to be a more pleasant person outside of yourself as opposed to within yourself.

#### Noteworthy Concepts

- Man with umbrella story
- Make it about what you can do for others
- Make people feel special and needed
- Negativity and attacking never got anyone their way
