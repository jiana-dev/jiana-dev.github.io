##### **What is it about?**

A book written by a professional dancer on fostering your own creativity, getting your creative gears turning, and understanding more about the process of creation. It also includes valuable words on forgiving yourself where necessary, and ideas on how you can do your best work. She gives practical activities to get you going creatively.

##### **What it Invoked In Me**

I didn't feel like everything in the book applied to me so much but the advice on harnessing creativity were enough to keep me reading this book. It invoked in me a fire to create. It made me want to spend time seeing what I can come up with creatively. Simultaneously makes me want to go go go! But also take the time to really consider the quality of the things I produce. I felt like it pulled out the artist side of me and gave me some good base knowledge on being a creative individual. I glazed over a lot of examples that I didn't resonate with or relate to as well. I also reserved reading the chapters for my creativity days.

##### **Who and When You Should Read This**

If you have any interest in creative endeavours and honing in on a "craft", this is for you! Use this when you feel creatively stuck or would love to enhance a skill with some guidance. Allow this to give you a better grasp on creativity and how you can harness it. I think this is very nice for a time when you need some motivation before beginning a project.
