##### **What is it about?**

Encyclopedia-like handbook heavily applicable to software developers, but can be applicable to anyone. Great advice on things like being more productive, becoming a mentor/mentee, **learning how to learn**, marketing yourself and your skills, basics to investing, fitness, working in a development environment, and just general good life advice.

##### **What it Invoked In Me**

Reading this had me nodding along with everything John Sonmez was saying, and taking notes for parts directly applicable to what I want to and am trying to do. I was made aware of the value of things I normally overlook, for example, the importance of teaching, speaking, getting good at presentations. He gave me perhaps one of the most important pieces of life advice I've ever gotten: "You only need to be a few steps ahead to teach someone something". This book really resonated with me and I highly recommend the time investment. Skim over the parts you think you have a good grasp on.

##### **Noteworthy Concepts**

- Being a mentor/mentee
- Quota and pomodoro system
- You only need to be a few steps ahead to teach someone something
- Create a learning/self-education plan â€” create a running list of your knowledge gaps
- The importance of speaking and presentations
- The importance of teaching
- The 10 Step Process to Learning
- How to market yourself
- Working from home advice (Ch. 15)
- Importance of specialization

##### **Who and When You Should Read This**

Most useful at any point after you've already started your career and have your gears going in it. Would also be useful as a student who is closer to finishing school, getting ready to enter the workplace. I think this material is best absorbed when read chunks at a time, especially when the chapter title is immediately relevant to your life.
